<p class="ph2">THE SLAVES OF SOCIETY</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">SCENE I<br />


<small>A MOTHER&#8217;S CARES</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">After</span> all,&#8221; sighed the marchioness, as
she conveyed a three-cornered piece of muffin
from the silver chafing-dish to her mouth,
and nibbled delicately at one of the corners&mdash;&#8220;after
all, what are we but slaves of
society?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Despencer extended a hand almost as
white and slender as the marchioness&#8217;s own,
and abstracted a small cube of sugar from
the porcelain basin, of the thinness and transparency
of a sea-shell, on the marchioness&#8217;s
silver tray, while he meditated a becoming
response.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he exclaimed, giving his head a
slow, mournful movement from side to side,
&#8220;you are right. We are no better off than
prisoners on the treadmill. Even you are
but a bird of paradise held captive in a gilded
cage.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bird of paradise removed the piece of
muffin from its beak to turn a pair of bright,
steel-blue eyes on the speaker, gazing at him
for some moments as though in doubt whether
to accept this beautiful sentiment as a tribute
or to rebuke it as a familiarity.</p>

<p>The cage so feelingly referred to was one
of a set of drawing-rooms on the first floor of
a mansion in Berkeley Square&mdash;that is to
say, in the heart of that restricted area within
which society requires its bond-servants to
reside during the spring and early summer.
The gilding consisted in a mural decoration
of the very latest and most artistic design,
representing a number of Japanese dragons
going through a kind of dragon drill, apparently
adapted to develop their tail muscles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
according to the system of Mr. Sandow; in
curtains of lemon-colored silk on each side
of the window and other curtains of lemon-colored
plush across the doorways; in a carpet
of that rich but chaotic pattern which has
been compared to the poetical style of the late
Robert Montgomery, and in a thicket of fantastic
and inconvenient chairs, of china-laden
cabinets and palms in Satsuma jars, which
would have rendered it extremely hazardous
for the gymnastic dragons to have come
down from the walls and transferred their
exercises to the floor of the apartment.</p>

<p>The inhabitant of this dungeon was a
handsome young woman of forty, or possibly
forty-five, with the fresh complexion and vivacious
expression of a girl, united with a
certain massiveness of outline, the inseparable
distinction of the British matron. Just
at this moment, moreover, her features were
hardened into that business-like aspect which
the British matron assumes when she is engaged
in doing that duty which England<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
expects of her no less than of its sea-faring
population.</p>

<p>Her companion looked even younger than
the marchioness. A rather pale face, set off
by a carefully cultivated black mustache,
gave him that air of concealed wickedness
which women find so interesting. His attire
was a little too elegant to be in perfect taste.
His bow was tied with an artistic grace repugnant
to the feelings of an English gentleman.
He was a typical specimen of that
class of man whom men instinctively taboo
and women instinctively confide in; who are
blackballed in the best clubs and invited to
all the best country-houses, who have no
male friends, and are on intimate terms with
half our peeresses. Sometimes these men
end by getting found out, and sometimes they
marry a dowager countess with money&mdash;and
a temper. As yet neither fate had overtaken
Mr. Despencer.</p>

<p>The marchioness decided that her companion
had been familiar.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be ridiculous!&#8221; she said, with some
sharpness. &#8220;I sent for you because I want
your assistance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Despencer meekly submitted to the reproof.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know I am always at your disposal,&#8221;
he murmured.</p>

<p>The marchioness glanced at him with a
questioning air, much as King John may be
supposed to have glanced at Hubert before
proceeding to introduce the subject of Prince
Arthur&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;They tell me you are horribly wicked,&#8221;
she remarked, in the tone of one who pays a
distinguished compliment, &#8220;so I feel I can
rely on you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In that case I must positively ask you to
go into another room,&#8221; returned Despencer,
with his best smile. &#8220;In your presence I find
my better instincts overpower me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness leaned back in her chair,
and half closed her eyes with an expression
of well-bred fatigue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t begin to say clever things.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
I want to talk sensibly.&#8221; She reopened her
eyes. &#8220;You see, I can&#8217;t speak to the marquis
because&mdash;well, he is rather old-fashioned
in some of his ideas; so I have to fall
back on you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Despencer slightly shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord Severn is certainly a trifle out of
date. He belongs to the solid-tire period.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly!&#8221; exclaimed the marchioness,
with some eagerness. The next moment she
recollected herself and frowned. Even the
fireside cat will sometimes protrude its claws
from under their velvet caps, and the marchioness
was not quite sure that she had
not felt a scratch. She frowned beautifully&mdash;the
marchioness&#8217;s frown was celebrated.
Then she observed: &#8220;Though I think it is
extremely impertinent of you to say so.
Please to remember that the marquis is my
husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! to be sure he is. I apologize. It is
so difficult to keep in mind these legal distinctions.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>This time the marchioness felt certain she
had been scratched. She glanced furtively
at her companion, who preserved the composure
of entire innocence as he set down his
empty teacup on a small ebony stool, inlaid
with mother-of-pearl, and made himself more
at ease by drawing back into his chair and
crossing his superbly trousered legs. After
a little pause, she asked suddenly:</p>

<p>&#8220;You know Mr. Hammond?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; The word was spoken with a touch
of disdain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not know Mr. Hammond! Why, I
thought Hammond&#8217;s ales were drunk in all
the clubs?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t follow that you know a man because
you drink his beer. But I have heard
of him. Isn&#8217;t he rather an outsider?&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness looked indignant.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is run after by all the best people,&#8221;
she remonstrated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but is he worth it?&#8221; returned Despencer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>&#8220;He is worth two millions,&#8221; retorted the
marchioness.</p>

<p>Despencer sat up in his chair and glanced
at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather a loud kind of man, they tell me,&#8221;
he observed.</p>

<p>&#8220;They tell me it is the thing to be loud
now,&#8221; said his companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sort of man that takes ballet-girls to
Richmond?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The sort of man that every mother in
England would welcome as a son-in-law.&#8221;</p>

<p>Despencer smiled compassionately and
leaned back in his chair again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, quite so. There could be no possible
objection to him as a son-in-law. I thought
you meant as an acquaintance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be so insolent,&#8221; said the marchioness;
&#8220;but listen. A man like that
ought to marry, and to marry well. If he
were to fall into the clutches of some vulgar
adventuress, I should regard it as a misfortune
for society.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>&#8220;This is very noble of you,&#8221; murmured her
companion.</p>

<p>She went on: &#8220;We are all so wretchedly
poor in society now that we can&#8217;t afford to
lose two millions. Besides, with his money
and a seat in Parliament, they are sure to
make him a peer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think that very likely. The
House of Lords is the one club in London
where you can&#8217;t be blackballed.&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness condescended to smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;How wretchedly jealous and spiteful you
are to-day! To come to the point. I have
determined to do my duty to society by marrying
Victoria to this man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Congratulations! Let me see, ought I to
call you a Spartan mother, or a Roman one?
I really forget.&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness raised her hand in languid
remonstrance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I begged you just now not to be clever.
Unfortunately, there is an obstacle in the
way.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>&#8220;Ah! I think I have heard something
about a gallant cousin?&#8221; Despencer suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no. Victoria has far too much sense
for that sort of thing. Besides, I don&#8217;t allow
Gerald here now. No, the obstacle I mean
is not a man, but a woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! now I see it is going to be serious.
Who is she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Belle Yorke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Belle Yorke!&#8221; Even Despencer&#8217;s careful
training did not enable him to hide his stupefaction
on hearing the name. &#8220;The celebrated
Belle Yorke?&#8221; he asked, staring hard
at the marchioness.</p>

<p>&#8220;The notorious Belle Yorke,&#8221; was the
scornful answer. &#8220;I understand she is
all the rage at the music-halls just
now, and Mr. Hammond is among her admirers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is not the only one,&#8221; said Despencer,
dryly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you look like that?&#8221; demanded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
the marchioness. &#8220;Is there some mystery
about Belle Yorke?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no! Oh, dear no! Very little mystery,
I should say,&#8221; and Despencer smiled.</p>

<p>The marchioness detected a history in the
smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then there is some scandal?&#8221; she asked,
eagerly, lowering her voice as people do when
they do not wish to be overheard by their
conscience. &#8220;I felt sure of it. I read in a
paper only the other day that all those people
on the stage were alike. Ahem! Mr. Despencer&mdash;what
do people <i>say</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>Despencer gave another light shrug. He
shrugged consummately. Despencer&#8217;s shrugs
were as celebrated as the marchioness&#8217;s
frowns.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do people generally say? It is the
usual story: the usual little cottage at Hammersmith,
the usual widowed mother, and
the usual friend who pays the rent.&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness&#8217;s look of horror would
have deceived experts.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>&#8220;How utterly depraved and shocking! I
never dreamed it was so bad as that! I
almost wish you hadn&#8217;t told me anything
about it. Ahem! Mr. Despencer&mdash;what do
they say is the friend&#8217;s name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, really!&#8221; For a moment Despencer
looked startled, then he smiled queerly.
&#8220;That is not at all a nice question. I really
don&#8217;t think you ought to ask me that.
I have such a dislike for scandal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So have I, except when I am listening to
it in the interest of propriety,&#8221; was the firm
answer. &#8220;I insist on knowing the friend&#8217;s
name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I have heard the lease is in the
name of a Mr. Brown.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Brown? Nonsense! That must be an
assumed name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very likely. In these cases I believe it
is not usual to put the gentleman&#8217;s real name
in the lease.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then&mdash;then&mdash;Mr. Despencer, what is the
real name?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>&#8220;Oh, marchioness!&#8221; Despencer drew back
and shook his head reproachfully. &#8220;Really,
you will bore me if you go on. I couldn&#8217;t
even guess the gentleman&#8217;s real name. It
might be anything&mdash;Smith, or Jones, or
President Kruger. It might be Hammond.&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness shook her head with conviction.</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t Hammond. I see you don&#8217;t understand
the situation.&#8221; An ironical smile
played for a moment on her companion&#8217;s
face. &#8220;No, if it were only idle folly, I should
try to shut my eyes to it. But I haven&#8217;t told
you the worst. I hear that Mr. Hammond&#8217;s
admiration for this person is perfectly honorable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That does sound bad!&#8221; Despencer returned,
gravely. &#8220;But I warned you against
the man. I told you he was an outsider.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not to be so flippant,&#8221; said the
marchioness, crossly. &#8220;Remember, you are
talking to a mother whose child&#8217;s happiness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
is at stake, and tell me what I am to do. You
see, the poor man evidently believes that this
girl is perfectly proper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he won&#8217;t believe <i>that</i> long, you may
be quite sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The question is, who will undertake to
open his eyes? It will really be doing him a
kindness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; but people are so ungrateful for
kindness,&#8221; objected the other. &#8220;Does this
man Hammond know the marquis?&#8221; he
asked, after a little hesitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I expect so. But it is quite useless to think
of him. He mustn&#8217;t be brought into it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Despencer smiled discreetly, as if he
thought it might be rather difficult to keep
the marquis out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Mr. Despencer, you are my only
hope,&#8221; pursued the marchioness. &#8220;I appeal
to you in the interests of society.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know I am your slave, marchioness.
But it will be a difficult thing to manage. I
almost think&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>Despencer broke off, and gazed thoughtfully
at his companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what is it? What do you suggest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fancy that the best thing you can do,
if you wish to bring matters to a head, is to
have Miss Yorke here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Despencer!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not? You see, it isn&#8217;t as though
she weren&#8217;t quite respectable. There may
be rumors about her, but then there are rumors
about everybody. If we paid attention
to rumors, we should all have to shut ourselves
up like hermits; except you, there is
not a woman in London whom I could visit.
As long as nothing is <i>known</i> about her, you
will be quite safe in having her here&mdash;of
course, I mean professionally.&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness looked a little relieved.</p>

<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t sound quite so bad,&#8221; she
admitted. &#8220;I could have her at my concert,
and let her sing something. I suppose she
wouldn&#8217;t be altogether too frightfully improper?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>&#8220;Oh, dear no! you needn&#8217;t fear anything
of that kind. Improper songs are quite gone
out at the halls now. All Belle Yorke&#8217;s are
about seamstresses who starve to death in the
East End, and ragged boys who insist on
taking off their jackets to wrap them round
their little sisters on doorsteps in the snow.
She makes people cry like anything. I have
seen a stockbroker sobbing in the stalls of
the Empire as if his heart would break when
the ragged boy gets frozen to death, and the
little sister wonders why he doesn&#8217;t answer
her any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How sweetly touching! I shall insist on
her singing that one here. I am sure I shall
cry.&#8221; The marchioness lifted a small gold
watch, the size of a bean, that swung from
a brooch on her left shoulder. &#8220;Can you
reach the bell? I must speak to Victoria before
anybody comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Despencer rose, and walked across the
room to press a small malachite knob placed
in the wall beside the fireplace, in accordance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
with that mysterious law of connection which
every one must have observed, though we believe
it has never been decided whether the
bell is an acquired characteristic of the fireplace,
or the fireplace an acquired characteristic
of the bell.</p>

<p>A perfectly constructed machine, bearing
considerable resemblance to a human
being, attired in a chocolate-colored suit
relieved with pink braid, opened the door,
and glided noiselessly into the room, stopping
with a slight jerk, as though the
clockwork had run down, at about three
paces inside.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is settled, then,&#8221; the marchioness
was saying when the machine entered. &#8220;I
shall get her here, and see what she is like.&#8221;
Her ladyship turned to the machine. &#8220;Go
and find Lady Victoria, and tell her I want
to speak to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>The machine made an inclination, revolved
on its castors, and noiselessly disappeared.
The marchioness continued:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>&#8220;I must have Mr. Hammond here as well,
I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is indispensable,&#8221; was the answer.
&#8220;And, by the way, I think it will be better
not to say anything beforehand to Lord
Severn.&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness looked surprised.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; she demanded.</p>

<p>Despencer gave another shrug.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought we agreed just now that he was
a trifle Early Victorian in some of his ideas.
He may have heard the rumors, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness had caught a step approaching.
She raised her hand with a warning
gesture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a word before Victoria!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">SCENE II<br />


<small>THE COURSE OF TRUE LOVE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> the marchioness was confiding her
maternal anxieties to Mr. Despencer&#8217;s sympathetic
ear, her daughter, Lady Victoria
Mauleverer, was engaged in calmly defying
her affectionate parent&#8217;s behests.</p>

<p>She was now in the adjoining room; but
the dust which yet lingered on her small and
delicately made shoes of dark green kid
would have revealed to the eye of one of
those marvels of astuteness who formerly
flourished, and, for aught we know, flourish
still in the pages of the popular monthlies,
that she had recently returned from out of
doors. Her perfectly plain skirt, not quite
long enough to conceal the shoes already
mentioned, might have suggested further<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
that the excursion had not been wholly unconnected
with a bicycle. Further incriminating
evidence was supplied by a dark
cloth jacket, similar in design to that worn
by the steward on board a yacht, but ornamented
with a number of oxidized steel buttons
of the size of crown pieces, and by a
straw hat indistinguishable from those ordinarily
worn by undergraduates.</p>

<p>In spite of these evidences of that removal
of the barrier between the sexes which is the
crowning triumph of our civilization, Lady
Victoria was a most attractive girl. She was
not quite so youthful as the marchioness,
but that could hardly have been expected.
At twenty, one is usually a hardened woman
of the world; at forty, one begins to be an
innocent little thing.</p>

<p>We have hinted that Lady Victoria had
just returned from a bicycle ride. It is
necessary to add that she had not returned
alone.</p>

<p>The companion who had escorted her, not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
only to the door of the house, but up-stairs, to
that of the drawing-room, was a tall, fine-looking
man of twenty-eight or thirty, whose
whole surface, from his boots to his forehead,
gleamed with that excess of physical polish
which is the religion of the British soldier.
It is not the only religion which demands
some intellectual sacrifice on the part of its
votaries.</p>

<p>As soon as the two were inside the room,
Lady Victoria turned to her companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;How can you be so imprudent, Gerald!
Do you know my mother is in the next
room?&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Mauleverer walked boldly forward,
and sat down without waiting to be asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; he answered, coolly. &#8220;That
is the reason why I have come into this
room. It was not my aunt whom I wanted
to see. You know, we are barely on speaking
terms.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t tell me that. I assure you
my mother has taken good care to let me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
know her opinion of you. I warn you plainly
that if she comes in and finds you here, I
shall abandon you to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Mauleverer tried to look unconcerned.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think you were such a coward as
that, Vick,&#8221; he remonstrated. &#8220;But, after
all, I don&#8217;t see that I have done anything so
very dreadful. She can&#8217;t forbid me the house
altogether, you know. I&#8217;m her own husband&#8217;s
nephew.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Victoria smiled with good-natured
scorn.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s nothing. You don&#8217;t know my
mother. She wouldn&#8217;t hesitate to forbid her
husband the house, if she wanted to. Husbands
occupy a very uncertain position in
society nowadays; they are only tolerated.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that a warning for me, I wonder?&#8221;</p>

<p>Something in her cousin&#8217;s tone, and the
look with which he accompanied the question,
brought out an impatient frown on
Victoria&#8217;s face. She walked over to the window,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
and stood tapping her foot against the
floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be ridiculous, Gerald! You know
as well as I do that it is not the slightest use
for this sort of thing to go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>She kept her back turned on him while
she spoke. There was a touch of softness
in his voice as he answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;It has gone on a long time, Vick, hasn&#8217;t
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A great deal too long,&#8221; was the reply,
spoken with decision. &#8220;You know it is perfectly
hopeless. You can&#8217;t afford me; I have
told you so over and over again. Why on
earth don&#8217;t you go and invest yourself in a
pork-butcher&#8217;s daughter from Chicago, like
everybody else?&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned on him with some fierceness as
she put the question. The captain looked
up at her reproachfully as he exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;What a hateful girl you are to talk like
that! You know perfectly well that you love
me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be vulgar, Gerald!&#8221; was the sharp
rebuke. &#8220;What has that to do with the question?
You know I am for sale, just like the
Zulu women. I don&#8217;t know exactly how
many cows I am worth, but I know I am one
of the most expensive girls in London.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Mauleverer pulled his mustache,
gazing at her with ill-concealed admiration.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, anyway, that is no reason why I
shouldn&#8217;t look in at the shop-window,&#8221; he
retorted, cheerfully.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that the machine
despatched by the marchioness entered the
room to summon Victoria to her mother&#8217;s
presence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there any one with the marchioness?&#8221;
she inquired.</p>

<p>The machine believed that Mr. Despencer
was with her ladyship.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good; I&#8217;ll come.&#8221;</p>

<p>As soon as the machine had withdrawn to
its subterranean abode, Captain Mauleverer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
asked, in the tone of a man who really desires
information:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who on earth <i>is</i> that man?&#8221;</p>

<p>Victoria looked blandly surprised.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Despencer, do you mean? I haven&#8217;t
the slightest idea.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the captain&#8217;s turn to look surprised.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I thought he was constantly in the
house.&#8221;</p>

<p>Victoria lifted her shoulders with fine disgust.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but I don&#8217;t know him. He is not
anybody, you know. I call him the Ladies&#8217;
Journal. He is not received; he circulates.
My mother takes him in, but I don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he one of those writing chaps?&#8221; inquired
the captain, with military contempt.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare say. He may be the Poet Laureate
for aught I know. But you must really go
away now, or there will be a row.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And when may I come back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be much better if you didn&#8217;t
come back at all.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>Captain Mauleverer shook his head as he
rose reluctantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no good talking like that, Vick. You
have got to put up with me, so you may as
well make the best of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gerald! what nonsense!&#8221; Victoria spoke
as though she were exceedingly cross. &#8220;Go
away directly; do you hear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t told me when I may see
you again yet,&#8221; returned the obstinate
Gerald.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not going to do anything of the
kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I shall stay here and compromise
you,&#8221; said Gerald, preparing to sit down
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&#8221;&mdash;she lowered her voice, with a
glance towards the door of communication
with the next room&mdash;&#8220;my mother has a concert
on Thursday night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Mauleverer brightened up.</p>

<p>&#8220;But if you come to it, I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t let you
speak to me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you?&#8221; He walked slowly towards
her.</p>

<p>As Captain Mauleverer went out of the
room by one door to go down-stairs and out
of the house, Lady Victoria went through
the other into the presence of her mother
and Mr. Despencer.</p>

<small>THE SLAVE OF ALDERMAN DOBBIN</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Yes</span>, mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Victoria bowed slightly to Despencer,
who had risen at her entrance,
and walked across to where the marchioness
was seated.</p>

<p>The marchioness gazed at her daughter as
if she had been a chimney-sweeper.</p>

<p>&#8220;You dreadful child! You know this is
my day, and you come in like that! Have
you no regard for people&#8217;s feelings?&#8221;</p>

<p>Victoria smiled disdainfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you mean Mr. Despencer&#8217;s feelings?&#8221;
she observed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean the feelings of society,&#8221; returned
her mother sternly. &#8220;You are more like an
anarchist than a well-bred girl.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>Lady Victoria indulged in the tiniest of
yawns.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think the anarchists are very interesting
people,&#8221; she remarked. &#8220;If it weren&#8217;t for
them, there would be nothing to read about
in the papers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There would be China,&#8221; returned the
marchioness in a shocked voice.</p>

<p>The marchioness considered herself a politician.
Her husband had once been Master
of the Deerhounds.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bother China!&#8221; said Lady Victoria, dropping
into a chair. &#8220;Is that what you sent
for me about?&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness raised her eyes in mute
appeal to the ceiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;I sent for you because I wanted to speak
to you privately before anybody comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Despencer, who had been about to sit down
again, stood up, and moved towards the door.
The marchioness recalled him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you wanted to be alone.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be absurd! I don&#8217;t count you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps Lady Victoria does,&#8221; Despencer
suggested, with a rather nervous glance in
her direction.</p>

<p>Lady Victoria did not condescend to return
the look.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray, don&#8217;t trouble yourself about me,
Mr. Despencer,&#8221; she said, negligently. &#8220;I assure
you I never know that you are in the
room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be rude, Victoria!&#8221; said her mother,
more crossly than she had spoken yet. &#8220;Mr.
Despencer is one of your best friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose that means he has been saying
something unpleasant about me?&#8221; was the retort.</p>

<p>Despencer ventured to interpose.</p>

<p>&#8220;I may be a poet, but my imagination
doesn&#8217;t carry me so far as that,&#8221; he said, in
his most insinuating tones.</p>

<p>Lady Victoria gave him one crushing look,
and turned to the marchioness.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear mother, I wish you wouldn&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
train Mr. Despencer to say these silly things.
Surely he is not a suitor for my hand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be quiet, Victoria!&#8221; said her indignant
parent. &#8220;From the way you treat him he
might be your husband. But I&#8217;m sure it
isn&#8217;t a thing for you to joke about. Do you
remember that this is your third season, and
that you are nearly twenty?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her daughter smiled in good-tempered derision.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think, as there is only Mr. Despencer
here, I may as well remember that it is my
fourth season, and that I am over twenty-one.&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness passed over the correction.</p>

<p>&#8220;All the more reason that you should seriously
consider your position. The question
is whether you really intend to be married
or not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely it isn&#8217;t a question of my intentions.
You had better ask the men theirs. I presume
they know I am in stock by this time.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>&#8220;It is idle to talk like that. I have offered
you three men already, and you found fault
with each of them.&#8221; The marchioness spoke
with real feeling. &#8220;There was Sir Humphrey
Bewley, a most eligible man, who quite
raved about you. You complained that he
was too old.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Old! He was prehistoric. He used to
get excited about the Conquest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you shouldn&#8217;t have encouraged
him. You let him spend a fortune in jewelry
for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was because I mistook his intentions.
I thought he wanted to adopt me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness gasped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk like that! Then there was
the Earl of Mullet. You objected to him because
he was a Scotchman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And took snuff. Put down the snuff.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He wouldn&#8217;t have made you take it. And
last year you refused Mr. Jacobson, whose
father owns three gold mines. You said he
was a Jew.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>&#8220;No, excuse me, I merely said his father
had been one.&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness shook herself impatiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Jews are most respectable,&#8221; she proclaimed,
&#8220;when they are rich enough. They
go everywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Except to the Holy Land, marchioness.&#8221;</p>

<p>The interruption came from Despencer. If
he threw in the remark with the hope of propitiating
Lady Victoria it was a failure. That
young lady took not the slightest notice. Her
mother glared at the traitor for an instant,
and continued as though he had not spoken.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is high time you made up your mind.
Now, there is Mr. Hammond, who has promised
to come here this afternoon. He has
been paying you attentions for some time.
You can&#8217;t say anything against him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Victoria had changed color slightly at the
mention of this name. But she responded, in
the same tone of languid indifference:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have nothing to say against him, except<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
that so far his intentions have not been
very oppressive. He has danced with me
three times, and he once peeled me an orange,
but you can hardly found a breach of promise
case on that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure,&#8221; ventured the unabashed
Despencer. &#8220;I fancy something might be
made out of the orange.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before the marchioness could proceed with
her lecture, the door opened, and the voice
of the machine announced, &#8220;Mr. Hammond!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bother the man!&#8221; muttered the marchioness,
impatiently, as she rose to receive him.
&#8220;He is a quarter of an hour too soon. This is
so good of you!&#8221; she exclaimed, in an altered
voice, as the form of the visitor appeared
in the doorway.</p>

<p>Mr. Hammond entered.</p>

<p>About his personal appearance there was
nothing remarkable. It is bad form to look
remarkable, and much of John Hammond&#8217;s
life had been devoted to avoiding everything
in the way of bad form. His attire was in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
every respect a perfect replica of that of any
other hundred men to be met between Waterloo
Place and Hyde Park Corner of an afternoon
in the London season. He was clean-shaven,
and his clear-cut features were those
of an able man, not yet entered upon middle
age, who has been accustomed to have the
world at his feet, and whose only anxieties
have been caused to him by his own ambition.</p>

<p>John Hammond was a favorable representative
of the class which is gradually replacing
the last remains of our feudal aristocracy.
The Hammond fortune had been
created by his father, so that he was not a
self-made man. In the sense in which the
word is used to-day, he was undoubtedly a
gentleman. He had been educated at the
best public school&mdash;that is to say, the most
expensive&mdash;in England, and in the most
fashionable college of the most fashionable
university. He had been in the best set,
both at school and at college, an advantage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
which his smartness as a wicket-keeper and
his inherited millions perhaps contributed
about equally to procure. He had taken a
good degree; he now took a cold bath every
morning, rode to hounds, and sat in the
House of Commons as a Conservative.</p>

<p>But John Hammond lacked one thing,
which neither money nor merit could procure.
He had not been born and reared in
an ancestral mansion, built in the days of
the Tudors or the Stuarts, on the site of a
Norman keep. He had not wandered as a
child through dusty galleries from whose
oak-panelled walls looked down the portraits
of dead generations of his name. He had
not heard from his nurse the story of the
loyal ancestor who fought for King Charles,
and of the wicked ancestor who killed his
rival in a duel, and of the beautiful ancestress
in whose praise poems had been written
by Waller or by Davenant. He had not
roamed as a boy through hereditary woodlands,
and bullied the keepers&#8217; sons whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
forefathers had served his from time immemorial.
He had not grown up with the
feeling in his blood that all this was part of
him, and he was part and lord of it. He
was only lord of a brewery, in which his
father had once brewed with his own hands.</p>

<p>If John Hammond had been brought up
in that other environment, he might not have
set store by it. If his lot had not cast him
among those to whom such things were matter
of course he might not have felt the deprivation.
He knew well enough that he had
advantages which, in the world&#8217;s estimation,
far outweighed those which he was without.
He knew that he lived in an age when the
homage which birth pays to wealth is open
and unashamed. He had seen peers bringing
their wives to wait in the halls of African
Jews. He had heard of mysterious checks
received by men of Norman lineage from
millionaires who sprang up in a night like
monstrous toadstools, and decayed, leaving
the air poisoned all around them. He had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
seen the noblest blood of England in the
dock, and the oldest blood of Scotland warned
off the turf.</p>

<p>His reason told him that he was immensely
the superior of such men; but no man&#8217;s beliefs,
any more than his actions, are governed
by reason. The acute logician who has failed
to prove to himself the existence of a God
takes refuge in the infallibility of a man.
John Hammond&#8217;s instinct told him that the
boasts of low-born poets were not altogether
truth, that the blood of the Howards did not
lose all its virtues even in the veins of sots
and slaves, that a gentleman was as much
above a king&#8217;s might as an honest man was,
and that neither kind heart nor simple faith
could take the place of one drop of Norman
blood.</p>

<p>Every man&#8217;s character has its weak spot,
and this was the weak spot in John Hammond&#8217;s.
There were moments when he despised
himself for the halo with which his
imagination encircled the heads of the caste<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
into which he had not been born. There
were other moments when he felt inclined to
marry the Lady Victoria Mauleverer.</p>

<p>Mr. Hammond entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you find me brutally punctual,
marchioness,&#8221; he said, in a vigorous, masculine
voice that seemed to go through the atmosphere
of the drawing-room like a breath
of fresh air. &#8220;That is the worst of business
habits. I wanted to wait down in the hall
till somebody else came, but they wouldn&#8217;t
let me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness smiled graciously, with
a horrible inward misgiving that Mr. Hammond
had overheard her rash protest against
his arrival.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you needn&#8217;t talk to me unless you
like,&#8221; he added, remorselessly, as he finished
shaking hands with the two women. &#8220;I will
sit still and look at photographs. Is this a
new one of Lord Severn?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not a moment too soon,&#8221; the dismayed
marchioness hastened to say. &#8220;Do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
you know Mr. Cyril Despencer, Mr. Hammond?&#8221;
The two men bowed with mutual
distrust. &#8220;I assure you we were absolutely
dying when you came.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really! I must apply for a medal from
the Royal Humane Society for saving life.&#8221;
He turned to Victoria, who had dropped into
her chair again with an elaborate assumption
of being bored to distraction. &#8220;Lady
Victoria, you are looking remarkably well for
a corpse.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laid down the marquis&#8217;s photograph,
and placed himself in a chair beside the
young woman. She barely raised her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks. I will tell my maid what you
say. She will be glad of a little encouragement,
poor thing!&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness gave a low moan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Victoria! I hope you are accustomed to
the modern girl, Mr. Hammond.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The modern girl is my particular hobby,&#8221;
was the grave answer. &#8220;I may say that I
collect her. I keep an album at home, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
which I get young ladies to record their most
secret thoughts and yearnings for my especial
benefit. It is such interesting reading.&#8221;
He turned again to the scornful beauty beside
him. &#8220;Mayn&#8217;t I put you in my album?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hardly know. I am afraid I should
shock you; I am so perfectly depraved,&#8221;
drawled Victoria. &#8220;You would have to keep
me apart, like those very select works of
which only a hundred copies are printed on
hand-made paper and sold by private subscription
to scholars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Victoria!&#8221; There was a note of real distress
in the marchioness&#8217;s voice. &#8220;What are
you talking about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare say Mr. Hammond knows,&#8221; was
the reply, in the same unmoved tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps Mr. Hammond collects those
works as well. They are generally written
by young ladies,&#8221; Despencer interposed.</p>

<p>Hammond turned and looked at him as if
a dog had barked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; but I think I have got a volume of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
yours on the same shelf, if you are the author
of <i>Fig Leaves</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Despencer became loftily indifferent.</p>

<p>&#8220;I remember writing a book with that name
when I was a boy. Do people still read it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; but they still look at the illustrations.&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness came to the rescue of her
satellite.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! but Mr. Despencer has reformed
since then,&#8221; she said, with unction. &#8220;He
is writing a novel in favor of marriage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How daring!&#8221; Hammond answered. &#8220;Of
course it will be refused by the libraries.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t allow you to say that
marriage is improper,&#8221; said the marchioness,
with an earnestness that was slightly clumsy.
&#8220;We still marry in society.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say so!&#8221; Hammond pretended
to exclaim. &#8220;I fancied it had quite gone
out. Isn&#8217;t it considered a rather middle-class
thing to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness refused to be baffled.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>&#8220;How horrid and cynical of you to talk
like that! You know that you ought to get
married yourself. Society expects it of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear marchioness, the views of society
are the last thing I think of considering.
My life is ordered by the views of Alderman
Dobbin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alderman Dobbin? That person you
asked me to send a card to? Who is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, this ignorance is discreditable to
you, marchioness. Alderman Dobbin is the
autocrat of the constituency I have the honor
to represent, the Chairman of the Tooting
Conservative Association. In me you behold
Alderman Dobbin&#8217;s slave. He is my moral
mentor and political taskmaster. Since I sat
for Tooting I have ceased to be a free citizen
with thoughts or ideas of my own. I am a
mere puppet, the strings of which are pulled
by him. The lips may be the lips of Hammond,
but the voice is the voice of Alderman
Dobbin.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>Lady Victoria raised her head with an appearance
of interest during this speech. She
now remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;From what you say, I am sure he is a
charming person. You have made me quite
in love with him. I shall flirt with him when
he comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond gazed at her with stern reproach.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lady Victoria, you commit yourself most
painfully. Alderman Dobbin is married.
Alderman Dobbin is the father of a large
family. Alderman Dobbin, moreover, is a
church-warden, and in the High Street of
Tooting the sinner trembles when he passes
the shop which bears Alderman Dobbin&#8217;s
name and superscription.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you see that you are simply making
me more determined by all this?&#8221; returned
Victoria. &#8220;I shall feel like the loreley, or
whatever they call it, luring the well-conducted
fisherman to his destruction.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you say he kept a shop?&#8221; put in the
marchioness, who already began to see in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
the alderman a possible ally. &#8220;What does
he sell?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Boots. Since I was returned for Tooting
my unworthy feet have been clothed in Alderman
Dobbin&#8217;s handiwork. The shoes
which I have on are made of a substance
which he supposes to be patent leather. They
are his choice, not mine. I am as wax in
his hands. If he required me to wear Wellingtons,
I should obey. At his bidding I
have changed my tailor and discharged my
groom; and if ever I want to choose a wife
I shall first have to ask Alderman Dobbin&#8217;s
consent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no doubt he is a very sensible man,
and you could not do better than take his advice,&#8221;
said the marchioness, who was quite
serious. &#8220;I am very glad he is coming here.
We don&#8217;t see nearly enough of the&mdash;er&mdash;the
other classes. When my husband was Master
of the Deerhounds, I once gave a thing
they called a Primrose Tea down at our place
in Worcestershire, but I didn&#8217;t speak to any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
of the creatures that came to it, except one
dreadful person, who, they told me, was a
justice of the peace. He called me &#8216;My
lady,&#8217; exactly like that delightful character
who wants to murder everybody in one of
somebody&#8217;s novels.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I expect the alderman will call you
&#8216;ma&#8217;am,&#8217;&#8221; observed Hammond, reflectively.</p>

<p>&#8220;I once knew a solicitor in a Welsh town,&#8221;
said Despencer, slowly, &#8220;where they had just
elected a peer of royal descent as mayor, and
this solicitor urged that they should return
another solicitor, who happened to be a Jubilee
knight, to the town council, in order that
his lordship might have some one of his own
rank to talk to.&#8221;</p>

<p>This time it was the marchioness who administered
a snub to the unlucky speaker.
She observed severely:</p>

<p>&#8220;As soon as any gentleman, in whatever
position, has received the accolade of his sovereign,
he ceases, in my opinion, to be a proper
subject for ridicule.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>Just as this rebuke was ended the door
opened quickly, and a small, insignificant-looking
man in a rather shabby lounge suit
strolled into the room. On catching sight
of the group round the marchioness he
stopped short, and looked as if meditating
flight.</p>

<p>The marchioness promptly took him into
custody.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray come in, George! This is quite too
charmingly domestic and suburban,&#8221; she observed,
addressing the company generally.
&#8220;My husband has actually come home to
tea.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Marquis of Severn, who was generally
supposed to haunt a small dark room
somewhere near the kitchen stairs, called by
courtesy the library, was plainly disconcerted
by the position in which he found himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really very sorry, Jane; but I didn&#8217;t
know you had a party on.&#8221; By this time he
had succeeded in recognizing the two men.
He gave Despencer a careless nod, and walked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
across the room to shake hands with Hammond.
&#8220;How d&#8217;ye do? I see you know my
women,&#8221; he remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear father,&#8221; Victoria remonstrated,
&#8220;if you are not careful you will wake up
some day and find yourself covered with
moss. Mr. Hammond and I are all but
engaged.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Victoria!&#8221; came in tones of stifled anguish
from the marchioness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you believe her, Severn,&#8221; laughed
Hammond. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t given your daughter
the slightest encouragement&mdash;as yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you should have my consent, if it
counted for anything,&#8221; said the marquis,
beginning to make his retreat from the room.</p>

<p>Again his wife&#8217;s voice arrested him.</p>

<p>&#8220;George, now you have come in, you must
stay, you know. I should consider it very
marked if you went away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t want me, Jane; I should only
be in the way,&#8221; he objected, feebly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You underrate your social powers, George.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
Besides, I don&#8217;t ask you to talk to any one. I
only want you to show yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s all, I&#8217;m sure I needn&#8217;t stay. But
I leave you my photograph.&#8221;</p>

<p>With these words Lord Severn made a bolt
for it, and succeeded in getting out of hearing
before his wife could launch a fresh injunction.</p>

<p>The marchioness bit her lip in some embarrassment.
Despencer caught her eye and
managed to infuse a certain meaning into his
look, as he asked aloud:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you going to have to sing on
Thursday night?&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness took her cue with the
dexterity of an old diplomatist. She leaned
back in her chair with an air of utter unconcern,
as she responded:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have almost forgotten. Some people
they recommended to me at the music-seller&#8217;s.&#8221;
She raised her hand to her brow, as
though studying to recollect. &#8220;Let me see.
Oh yes, there is one woman who I believe is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
perfectly charming. They told me that at
the music-halls all the young men were dying
for her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond moved his head rather abruptly
to look at the speaker.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you remember her name?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think she calls herself Belle Yorke.
Why, have you seen her?&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness&#8217;s expression was one of
innocent surprise at the strong interest plainly
depicted on her listener&#8217;s countenance.</p>

<p>Before he could reply to her, the conversation
was again interrupted. The machine
had brought a Dowager Lady Rollox and an
Honorable Edith Rollox to see his mistress.</p>

<p>The marchioness seized the occasion with
the instinct of a match-maker.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come and help me to talk to these stupid
people,&#8221; she breathed hurriedly in Despencer&#8217;s
ear, as she rose and went to meet the newcomers.
Despencer meekly obeyed.</p>

<p>The little piece of by-play between her
mother and Despencer had not been lost on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
the Lady Victoria Mauleverer. As soon as
she and Hammond were left together she
inquired, with an air of doubt:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know anything about this Belle
Yorke?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond roused himself with a start from
his reflections.</p>

<p>&#8220;I? Belle Yorke? Yes, yes. I know
something about her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope there&#8217;s nothing wrong about her
coming here?&#8221; pursued Victoria, with superb
coolness. &#8220;She won&#8217;t do anything dreadful,
will she?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond braced himself up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have the honor of being a friend of Miss
Yorke&#8217;s, and I respect her as much as any
other lady of my acquaintance,&#8221; he said
firmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; Victoria said, lightly.
&#8220;I only asked because my mother is so very
indiscreet. She makes me quite giddy sometimes.
One meets such very queer people in
this house&mdash;the Ladies&#8217; Journal, for instance.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>&#8220;Meaning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t you know? It&#8217;s what we call
Mr. Despencer behind his back. He is so
well informed, you know, on certain subjects.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder what you call me behind my
back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we think very highly of you, I can
tell you. I believe my mother is quite anxious
that I should marry you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me see, I rather fancy I am engaged
just now, but I shall be charmed to break it
off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope Alderman Dobbin will approve of
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond affected to shake his head in
doubt.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will have to satisfy him as to your
moral character.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That will be rather difficult,&#8221; Victoria
admitted. &#8220;Perhaps you had better not let
him know that I cycle.&#8221; She glanced down
at her costume as she spoke. &#8220;But I must
really go and put on decent things before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
anybody else comes, or the alderman may
hear of it. We shall see you at the concert, I
suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and the alderman,&#8221; said Hammond.</p>

<p>He was slipping away a few minutes later,
when he found himself intercepted in the
doorway by Despencer.</p>

<p>Despencer addressed him in a confidential
tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, you heard what the marchioness
said just now. Do you think any one ought
to give a hint to Lord Severn?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what about?&#8221; asked Hammond,
surprised.</p>

<p>&#8220;About Belle Yorke. She oughtn&#8217;t to
come here, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; demanded Hammond, frowning
angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you know?&#8221; Despencer&#8217;s expression
became that of a man who finds he has
innocently committed himself. &#8220;Perhaps I
ought not to have spoken to you about it;
but I thought the story was public property.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>&#8220;What story? I wish you would speak
out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Despencer glanced round cautiously, and
lowered his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it may be only idle rumor.
But they say that she is living under his
protection.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is false!&#8221; said Hammond.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">SCENE IV<br />


<small>THE NOTORIOUS BELLE YORKE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Yorke</span> was out, but the servant,
whose dishevelled coiffure indicated that she
had been interrupted in the midst of her afternoon
toilette, thought that Miss Yorke
would be in directly. Would the gentleman
like to step in and wait?</p>

<p>The gentleman accepted the invitation,
giving his name as Hammond. He found
himself in one of those curious apartments
characteristic of the suburbs of London, and
known as parlors, a word believed to be derived
from the French. Like the rooms of
state in Buckingham Palace, the parlor does
not enter into the daily life of the household,
but is reserved for occasions of ceremony, and
more particularly, as its name indicates to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
the learned, for interviews with visitors. The
parlor of the notorious Belle Yorke was more
old-fashioned in appearance than most rooms
of its class. The furniture was veneered in
rosewood. There was a round table in the
centre, covered with a cloth over which the
deadly gift-book and the paralyzing parlor-game
were disposed with a carelessness which
spoke of greater care. There was a sofa, attired
in a chintz dressing-gown. There were
two easy-chairs flanking the fireplace, one
with arms for the gentleman, and one without
for the lady, as in old crinoline days, and
there were six little chairs to match, all irresistibly
suggestive of one of those ancient
tombs on which the father and mother are
represented kneeling opposite each other,
each with a row of children behind. There
was a species of disguised wash-stand, called
a chiffonnier, ranged against one side of the
room, and a piano against another. The
walls were hung with prints, chiefly Scriptural
subjects, among which the place of honor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
was taken by an engraving representing
the marriage of the Prince and Princess of
Wales. It was a scene of primeval simplicity
and Nonconformist peace.</p>

<p>Hammond looked about him with a sense
of intrusion, as he found himself for the first
time in Belle Yorke&#8217;s home. It was utterly
unlike anything he had expected to find.
Belle Yorke lived in that part of Hammersmith
which had not yet succeeded in covering
itself with flats and calling itself West
Kensington. The house outside was small
and unpretentious; but so are the outsides of
many houses which are gay enough within.
Miss Yorke&#8217;s appearance on the boards was
too recent for her yet to have furnished a
miniature palace and set up a brougham on
the proceeds of the public favor. But the domestic,
old-fashioned air which pervaded the
whole place came on Hammond as a surprise
and a rebuke.</p>

<p>The servant who had just shown him in asked
a question which further opened his eyes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>&#8220;Would you like to see Mrs. Yorke, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond started.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that Miss Yorke&#8217;s mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does she live here?&#8221;</p>

<p>The servant opened her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lor&#8217;, yes, sir! This is &#8217;er &#8217;ouse!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond considered for a minute.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you can tell Mrs. Yorke I am here,
if you like.&#8221;</p>

<p>The servant nodded and went out, leaving
him to his reflections.</p>

<p>In love, as in war, there is an armed neutrality
when the period of friendship has
passed away, but neither side is yet ready for
a declaration. Just such a stage had been
reached in the joint history of John Hammond
and Belle Yorke.</p>

<p>He had met her in Bohemia, that pleasant
country which the passing tourist sees only
in its brightest garb, when the trees are
green in the valleys and the vines are ripening
in the warm sunshine. The manners of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
Bohemia are freer than those of other lands,
and among that friendly folk the course of
acquaintanceship between a man and a woman
is not curbed and governed and interpreted
quite as it is in the dominions of society.</p>

<p>So the millionaire had drifted into a friendship
with the music-hall singer without any
after-thought; and when the after-thought
had gradually grown up of its own accord, he
had found it the most comfortable plan to
shut his eyes to it and make believe it was
not there.</p>

<p>If he had been ten years younger, the Marchioness
of Severn might have despaired of
her son-in-law. But he had come to that age
when life begins to change its aspect; when
the white blossom of romance with which it
tempts the eye of youth begins to shed its
petals, and the red fruit of ambition is disclosed.
John Hammond was still young
enough to love, but he was old enough to
count the cost.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>For some time he had been doing his best
to convince himself that he had not the slightest
intention of marrying Belle Yorke. He
had grown more and more assured of this;
and, naturally, the more confident he became
of his resolution to give her up, the more her
charm for him increased. He set up the old,
old debtor-and-creditor account between prudence
and inclination. He did penance for
his friendship with Belle Yorke by his flirtation
with Lady Victoria Mauleverer, and
repaid himself for his attentions to Lord
Severn&#8217;s daughter with a smile from the
singer.</p>

<p>To a man in such a state of self-deception
Despencer&#8217;s poison came as a tonic. His
wrath at hearing her attacked, and the necessity
he felt of being able to rebut the accusation,
were the measure of his love for the woman
he had resolved never to love.</p>

<p>It was twenty-four hours since the little
episode at the Marchioness of Severn&#8217;s.
Hammond&#8217;s blunt contradiction had glided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
harmless off the imperturbable Despencer,
who had murmured some vague apology
and made his escape, leaving his sting behind.
There was no wisdom in rubbing it
in then. It was better to let it rankle during
the interval before the concert. It was then
that Despencer intended to play out his winning
cards.</p>

<p>Despencer&#8217;s words had been the first intimation
to Hammond of the existence of any
such ill report. Promptly as he had spurned
it, the incident had served to remind him
roughly of how little he really knew of this
girl who had come to hold such a large place
in his life. He had seen much of her in Bohemia,
enough for those lookers-on who always
see our motives and aims so much more
clearly than we do ourselves to write him
down her lover. But then no one lives altogether
in Bohemia. Even the oldest inhabitants
are only migratory; like the swallows,
they have their seasons of coming and of
flight, and who knows in what strange lands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
they spend the other periods of their existence!
Intimate as they were in that sunlit
region, Hammond felt that there were reserves
in the singer&#8217;s life. One of those reserves was
her home, which she had steadily avoided
showing him. He knew as little of her private
life, indeed, as any stranger in the stalls
who heard her sing.</p>

<p>He had come away from the house in Berkeley
Square resolving to dismiss the slander
from his mind. He spent the next night and
morning in the vain effort, and in the afternoon
he came to Belle Yorke&#8217;s house. It was
not till he found himself waiting alone in the
little parlor, surrounded by the Scriptural
prints and parlor games, that Hammond
began to ask himself what madness had
brought him to such a place with any
thought of evil in his heart.</p>

<p>He was not left alone for very long. He
heard steps outside, and the sound of the
door-handle turning in the lock. He rose
to his feet, expecting to see Belle Yorke&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
mother. Instead there entered a small boy
in knickerbockers, apparently about twelve
or thirteen years of age.</p>

<p>The boy seemed to be quite as much surprised
to see Hammond as Hammond was
to see him. He stood in the doorway, frankly
staring at the visitor. Hammond had
time to notice that he wore a black cloth band
on the sleeve of his plain homespun jacket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in, my boy; don&#8217;t be afraid,&#8221; he
said, with that awkward patronage by which
grown-up people render themselves so supremely
ridiculous to the intelligent modern
child.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not afraid,&#8221; the boy replied, boldly,
advancing into the room. &#8220;Why should I
be afraid of you?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not a question which the man found
it easy to reply to. He smiled, and then
asked, rather lamely:</p>

<p>&#8220;And what might your name be?&#8221;</p>

<p>The justly offended youth retorted mercilessly:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>&#8220;It might be Napoleon Bonaparte, but,
as it happens, it&#8217;s Robert Mainwaring
Yorke.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond felt that he had put himself in
the wrong. He tried to address the boy like
one on his own level.</p>

<p>&#8220;I called here to see Miss Belle Yorke.
She is your sister, I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>Robert Mainwaring Yorke had not yet lost
his sense of irritation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you don&#8217;t think she&#8217;s my mother,
do you?&#8221; he replied, with severity. &#8220;She&#8217;s
my eldest sister,&#8221; he condescended to explain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, then there are several of you?&#8221; said
Hammond, wonderingly. It was the first
time he had ever heard of Belle Yorke&#8217;s family.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think?&#8221; returned the boy.
&#8220;There&#8217;s Lizzie&mdash;that&#8217;s my second sister;
and Arthur&mdash;he&#8217;s a year younger than me;
and Reggie&mdash;he&#8217;s a year younger; and the
kid&mdash;he&#8217;s only four. Anything else you&#8217;d
like to know?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>&#8220;And who is Mr. Yorke?&#8221; asked Hammond.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Mr. Yorke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; Hammond
began, and then, catching sight of the
black band, stopped, as though he had bitten
his tongue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father&#8217;s dead,&#8221; Mr. Yorke explained, unconcernedly.
&#8220;He died last winter, and I&#8217;m
the head of the family.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know; I beg your pardon. Your
sister is not in mourning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He wasn&#8217;t her father. Belle&#8217;s only my
half-sister. Her father died when she was
a kid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see. And I suppose your mother married
again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose so, or I shouldn&#8217;t be here.&#8221;</p>

<p>A fresh thought occurred to Hammond.
If what the boy said was true, he did not
even know Belle Yorke&#8217;s real name. He
was on the point of putting a question to the
boy, but restrained himself. He had no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
right to seek that information from any one
but Belle Yorke herself.</p>

<p>Mr. Yorke seized the opportunity to put in
a word for the absent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mind you, I look on Belle as just as good
as a whole sister,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
make any difference.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is kind to you, then?&#8221; At least he
might have the pleasure of listening to Belle
Yorke&#8217;s praise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know that you can call it
kind,&#8221; said the boy, with another touch of
resentment at the implied inferiority. &#8220;She&#8217;s
just like any other sister. She knits my
stockings for me, and does whatever I want
her to. She&#8217;s not a bad sort.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She must be fond of you,&#8221; observed the
man, gazing at the ungrateful little wretch
with wondering amusement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, oh, she&#8217;s fond of me! When I had
the chicken-pox she took me to Brighton for
a fortnight, all at her own expense, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
stayed with me all the time, and wouldn&#8217;t go
out anywhere, though she had lots of invitations.
Belle&#8217;s very good in that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man felt a strong inclination to shake
Belle Yorke&#8217;s callous brother, as he thus
grudgingly praised her. It was with an uneasy,
self-reproachful feeling that he put the
next question:</p>

<p>&#8220;Your sister must make a good many
friends by her singing?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Yorke nodded superciliously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; but she doesn&#8217;t care much for that
lot; they&#8217;re not very respectable, we think.
We don&#8217;t like her going on the stage at all;
but she wanted to do something to earn her
living. As soon as ever I&#8217;m a man, and get
rich, I&#8217;m going to take her out of that and
have her live with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond looked up, pleased.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, the little chap&#8217;s a brick, after all!&#8221;
he mentally ejaculated.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll make a very good housekeeper,&#8221;
concluded Mr. Yorke.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>Hammond started to his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t question this child,&#8221; he said to
himself. And turning to the boy, he said,
abruptly: &#8220;Will you ask your mother if I
can see her?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Yorke instantly responded to the tone
of authority and became respectful.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; he answered, and promptly went
out of the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;By Heaven, I have a great mind to bolt!&#8221;
exclaimed Hammond as the door closed. &#8220;I
feel like a miserable spy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before he could act on his impulse the
door opened again, and Belle Yorke&#8217;s mother
came in.</p>

<p>Hammond rose. He saw before him a
woman who had once been eminently handsome.
She was dressed in the deep mourning
of a widow, and to this fact, perhaps,
was due the impression of melancholy
produced by her appearance. She looked
at him with large, apprehensive eyes, as
she murmured the conventional expressions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
which people exchange when they
meet. But she did not offer him her
hand.</p>

<p>As soon as both were seated, Mrs. Yorke
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand you have called to see my
daughter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Perhaps she has mentioned my
name to you some time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She has. She has often spoken of you.
But she didn&#8217;t tell me that you were coming
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond bit his lip.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean, she told you that I was not
coming&mdash;that she had discouraged me from
visiting her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no; I didn&#8217;t mean that,&#8221; Mrs. Yorke
stammered. &#8220;I am sure that there is no
one whom my daughter would be more
pleased to see here than you, if she received
any visitors at all outside our friends in
the neighborhood. But she has made it
a fixed rule not to invite any of the acquaintances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
she makes on the stage to come
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond listened to this explanation with
a feeling of relief. It was something to find
that if he were excluded the exclusion was
not personal to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please deal frankly with me, Mrs. Yorke,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;If you think Miss Yorke would
consider my visit an intrusion, tell me so,
and I will go away before she comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not an intrusion; that is scarcely the
word. But I am afraid she will be disturbed
at finding you here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why? Surely there is no harm in a
friend like myself calling on her beneath her
own mother&#8217;s roof?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Yorke gave a questioning glance at
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hardly know what to say to you, Mr.
Hammond. You call yourself my daughter&#8217;s
friend, but what do you really know
about her?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond was silenced. He recalled the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
discovery that he had just made, that he did
not even know the true name of the girl
whom he had come to question, and he began
to feel vaguely uncomfortable. He answered,
rather lamely:</p>

<p>&#8220;I can only say that it is my greatest ambition
that you and your daughter should
include me among your friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Yorke shook her head with a resolution
that had a certain sadness in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;How can you be our friend? What is
there in common between you and us? It
would have been better if you had not come
here, Mr. Hammond.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you say that?&#8221; he protested.
&#8220;Why should you think it necessary to keep
me at arm&#8217;s length like this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely you must see that for yourself.
You know well enough what the world thinks
of such friendships between a gentleman in
your position and a singer on the music-hall
stage. What impression would it make on
your mind, if you found my daughter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
receiving the visits of one of your society
friends?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond was staggered by this unconscious
reference to his own doubts. He
could only reply:</p>

<p>&#8220;That would depend on many things&mdash;for
instance, whether I believed him to be actuated
by the same motives as myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not see what difference his motives
could make. It is impossible for me to look
upon attentions from one in your position as
likely to lead to any good result.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why not?&#8221; Hammond pleaded, earnestly.
&#8220;It is true that, as you say, I
know but little of Miss Yorke. But that
little has been enough to make me wish to
know more. Is there any reason why I
should not? I will be plain with you, on
condition that you will be plain with me.
Is there any reason why you should not
allow me to visit your house on the footing
of one who means to ask you for your
daughter&#8217;s hand?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>Mrs. Yorke recoiled. Instead of showing
common surprise at the question, or that
gratification which the ordinary mother feels
when such words are addressed to her by a
man far her child&#8217;s superior in wealth and
station, an anxious, frightened look came
into her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you must not think of that!&#8221; she exclaimed,
hastily; and then added, in a calmer
tone: &#8220;Such a marriage would be impossible.
The difference between her and you is
too great.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It has been crossed before now,&#8221; returned
Hammond. &#8220;If you have no better
reason for your refusal than that, I shall
stay.&#8221; And he settled himself firmly in his
chair.</p>

<p>Mrs. Yorke wrung her hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you compel me like this? I have
another reason&mdash;don&#8217;t ask me what it is!&mdash;for
telling you that this cannot be.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond started, and gazed at her with
a new apprehension, not less than her own.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
He could scarcely muster up courage to put
his next question.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must ask you. You have gone too far,
and I have gone too far, to draw back
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I shall ask your daughter herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, anything but that!&#8221; She rose to her
feet, trembling. &#8220;I beg you, I ask you as a
gentleman, to go, and leave us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond rose dismayed. He had taken
two steps towards the door when it was
thrown open and Belle Yorke stood revealed
on the threshold.</p>

<p>The notorious Belle Yorke did not look the
part. People said it was her air of bright,
girlish innocence, so foreign to the footlights,
which was the secret of her success. When
she tripped on to the stage from behind the
painted side scenes, looking as if she had
just come out of some rustic cottage in that
far-off land called &#8220;the country,&#8221; and began
singing one of her simple ballads, in a voice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
clear and fresh as the tinkle of a brook among
the hills, they said it was the contrast with
all her surroundings which caused such a
thrill of emotion to go through the jaded
audience. Of course no one believed that
it was real innocence and real freshness.
Belle Yorke was simply a little more clever
than her professional sisters, and had thought
out a &#8220;turn&#8221; which had the advantage of
novelty; that was all. But it was very well
done, so well that some quite hardened men
of the world were ashamed afterwards to
recall how far they had yielded to the spell.
They declared that she made up better than
any other woman on the stage, and that hers
was the art which conceals art, except, of
course, from such complete judges as themselves.</p>

<p>Those who had met her off the stage found,
to their surprise, perhaps to their disappointment,
that Belle Yorke seen close at hand
was very much like Belle Yorke upon the
boards. She was not to be found drinking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
brandy in the bar while she was waiting for
her turn to go on. She did not go from the
music-hall to a fashionable restaurant, and
sit in public with a group of male admirers
round her. She was generally seen slipping
out quietly and going off on foot, or, if she
found herself threatened with companionship,
she took refuge in a cab. There was
clearly some mystery underneath such conduct,
and the mystery could be of only one
kind.</p>

<p>Belle Yorke was friendly but not familiar
with her stage associates. Perhaps there is
no course which gives more offence than that.
It is much easier to forgive downright rudeness
than the perfect courtesy which makes
others keep their distance. Some of the affronted
ones were women, and the charity of
women for women, as a rule, is not of the kind
which covereth a multitude of sins. The eyes
that began to watch Belle Yorke were robbed
of sleep by jealousy. Something like a throb
of exultation went through the ranks of those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
to whom Belle Yorke&#8217;s innocence was a stumbling-block
when it was discovered that Belle
Yorke had a friend.</p>

<p>Mr. Despencer, to do him justice, had not
invented, nor had he originated, the report
which he had mentioned to the marchioness,
and repeated to Hammond. It goes without
saying that he believed it to be true. Such
reports are like Euclid&#8217;s axioms: no one requires
to have them demonstrated. It had
not even occurred to him that he was doing
an injury to Belle Yorke in repeating it; nor
did it injure her in the eyes of the public, nor
in those of the managers of the music-halls.
What a woman loses in reputation she gains
in celebrity. As soon as Belle Yorke&#8217;s manager
heard that she was protected by the Marquis
of Severn he rubbed his hands and
silently raised her salary.</p>

<p>When Belle Yorke opened the door and saw
who was in her mother&#8217;s parlor she stood still,
betrayed into a stifled cry and a blush that
would not be stifled. Then she stepped in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
slowly, and laid down on the table some paper
bags which she was carrying in her hands.</p>

<p>A pang of compunction shot through Hammond&#8217;s
breast as she raised her eyes to his.
There was something in Belle Yorke&#8217;s eyes
which touched most people. They were always
laughing, and yet somehow it always
seemed as though they were laughing in
order to keep themselves from tears. Looking
into their clear depths, the man felt ashamed
of his errand, and ashamed of his presence
there, and he stood before her unable to speak.</p>

<p>It was she who found words first.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is too bad of you, Mr. Hammond!
You had no business to come here. You
know I don&#8217;t allow it.&#8221;</p>

<p>But there was something in the voice that
undid the reproach of the words. Hammond&#8217;s
courage came back to him again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no defence to make,&#8221; he answered,
in the same light vein. &#8220;The temptation
was too strong for me, and I yielded to it. I
plead the First Offenders&#8217; Act.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>Belle turned gayly to her mother, who had
concealed, by a strong effort, all traces of her
recent agitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;What punishment shall we give him? I
think, sir, you shall be sentenced to stay to
tea.&#8221;</p>

<p>She opened the paper bags, and produced
a store of those fearful and wonderful delicacies
variously named crumpets, or pikelets,
and said to have been invented by a member
of the medical profession.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see you are in luck. To-day is
Bobby&#8217;s birthday, and we are going to have
a cake and all sorts of luxuries.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond began to feel like a man in a
dream. He had walked straight out of tragedy
into comedy. He had come to Hammersmith
in search of an answer to the most terrible
question which can present itself to a
man who loves a woman, and he found himself
in the midst of a children&#8217;s tea-party.
Perhaps this was the answer, the best of answers,
to the doubt which had striven to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
effect a lodgment in his mind. Sitting there,
in the midst of Belle Yorke&#8217;s little brothers
and sisters, as they trooped into the feast,
watching her feed the hungry swarm, he
found his dark thoughts dying away of themselves.
Such an atmosphere was fatal to
them; they could not live in it.</p>

<p>So the millionaire forgot his millions and
his marchionesses and his ambitions, and
threw himself into the spirit of the festival
with such cordiality that he won the children&#8217;s
hearts. Mr. Yorke, forgetting his former animosity,
cut him the biggest slice of the birthday-cake
with his own hands, and edified him
with a full, true, and particular account of his
exploits on the football field in that famous
match between the Hammersmith Juniors
and the Brook Green Stars, which is now
matter of history. Master Reginald Yorke
insisted on sitting on the stranger&#8217;s knee,
and sharing with him the contents of a paper
of brown sweetmeats, highly flavored with
peppermint, which he called bull&#8217;s eyes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
Belle&#8217;s grateful looks repaid him for his
submission to these outrages, and when he
rose reluctantly to go away he felt there was
a new tie between them, stronger than there
had been before.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I come to tea again, some time?&#8221; he
pleaded, as she went with him to the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;When you are asked,&#8221; said Belle.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">SCENE V<br />


<small>A PERSON OF IMPORTANCE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a substantially-built house in the important
suburb of Tooting, in a dining-room
full of substantial furniture in that school
of design which is the glory of Britain and
the stupefaction of surrounding nations, sat
Alderman Dobbin, J. P., reading the <i>Church
Gazette</i>, and breathing Protestantism at every
pore.</p>

<p>The person of Alderman Dobbin was not
less substantial than the chair which supported
it. It was the hour of three in the afternoon;
the alderman had just achieved a
dinner of solid and ample materials, and a
gentle flush which overspread his broad face
was due perhaps equally to the silent struggle
going on in the region of his waistcoat and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
to indignation at the insidious practices of
Rome.</p>

<p>It is not till a gigantic public evil begins
to affect us personally that we become really
in earnest for its redress. Alderman Dobbin
had long marked the stealthy encroachment
of ritual in the Church from afar with inward
misgiving. But when the arising of a new
vicar of the most lawless school brought the
mischief to the door of the alderman&#8217;s own
pew, when the audacious cleric presumed to
burn frankincense or some such idolatrous
drug under the alderman&#8217;s own nostrils,
then, in his own words, he realized that we
were on the verge of a revolution. It was
fortunate indeed for the offender that the ordinary
justice of the peace has no jurisdiction
in ecclesiastical causes. Alderman Dobbin
did not brawl in the church&mdash;such a man
could not brawl; but he wrote a letter to the
paper, and he intimated to his vicar in the
privacy of the vestry that he should reconsider
his attitude towards disestablishment.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>To the culprit, standing on the great peaks
of Catholic verity, clasping hands with sixty
generations of apostles, fathers, saints, and
bishops, his rebellious church-warden naturally
mattered no more than a gnat buzzing
round the altar. His spiritual predecessors
had cast down emperors from their thrones,
and given away largess of kingdoms. Was
he to surrender the &#338;cumenical splendors of
the Church at the bidding of an obscure suburban
tradesman? If this impertinent boot-maker
represented the feelings of the laity,
so much the worse for the laity. The Church
could get on without <i>them</i>, but not without its
apostolic priesthood.</p>

<p>Such disdain, to the worthy alderman, was
at once an outrage and a revelation. It is
possible that there are social circles in which
even an alderman is not removed beyond the
reach of rivalry; but in the meridian of Tooting,
where Alderman Dobbin had passed his
life, and where his high office, together with
his equally high moral character, had hitherto<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
secured him universal deference, he felt
himself to be an important personage. After
all, importance is a question of standpoint.
Every one has some one to look up to him.
Though you be but a youth of lowly birth,
engaged in mercantile pursuits, with a stipend
of no more than thirty weekly shillings,
yet to the landlady who tolls you in a moiety
of that sum you are a power whose favor is to
be conciliated, and whose wrath is to be dreaded.
To the drudge in the basement who
blacks your boots and watches you through
the area railings as you issue forth of a morning
you are as a god moving on Olympus;
the conductor who takes you to your work in
his omnibus holds you for an undoubted
member of the aristocracy; and the drunken
artisan on the roof, earning his pound a day
on every day that he can spare from the public-house,
hates you for your pride and luxury.</p>

<p>Novelists, it is said, are thought much of
by young reporters on the provincial press.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
The secret of true happiness is to turn away
from beholding those who are better off than
ourselves, and keep the gaze steadily fixed
on those who are worse off; and this secret
Alderman Dobbin had mastered. Free from
that itching to grovel to some one above him
which torments so many unfortunate people,
he was satisfied with being grovelled to by
his inferiors. Thus it was that he had been
able to live in the enjoyment of his own greatness
without envying that of others. There
might be such persons as dukes and archbishops
in the world&mdash;he was Alderman
Dobbin.</p>

<p>So much the greater was the shock administered
to his mind by the unveiled disrespect
of the vicar. The alderman&#8217;s evangelical
zeal had received a new edge; and, at the
same time, by a natural chain of cause and
effect, he was in a mood peculiarly susceptible
to the blandishments of one of those magnates
of the earth before whom even Oxford
divines are but as dust. Such a one was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
even now approaching the aldermanic dwelling.</p>

<p>A sound of horses&#8217; hoofs and carriage
wheels aroused the nodding alderman, and
drew him hastily to the window. He beheld
a carriage and pair of the most brilliant lustre
drawing up in front of his door, and a woman
of stately presence looking out, while a liveried
footman ascended the steps and rang
the bell. The excited master of the house
could scarcely refrain from bursting out into
the hall, to anticipate the lagging motions of
the housemaid. At last that young female,
having arranged her cap to her satisfaction,
could be heard flouncing past the dining-room
door. A short colloquy followed, and
the occupant of the carriage emerged, attended
by a fashionably dressed gentleman,
and entered the house. There was a sound
of doors opening and shutting. Finally, the
housemaid came to her impatient master.</p>

<p>&#8220;A lady by the name of Seven, and a
gentleman, to see you, sir.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>&#8220;Seven?&#8221; The alderman reflected for a
moment, and then his eye fell on a card of
invitation which had occupied a prominent
place on the mantel-piece and in his thoughts
for several days past. &#8220;You mean Lady
Severn,&#8221; he cried out&mdash;&#8220;the Marchioness of
Severn!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir; &#8216;Lady Severn&#8217; was what she
said, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>The alderman cast a glance of despair at
his trousers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Run and get me the clothes-brush. No&mdash;I
must change&mdash;there isn&#8217;t time! Here,
run up-stairs and get me my Sunday coat,
while I brush these things.&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness and her companion, seated
in the drawing-room, were aware of a commotion
outside.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid we have thrown the establishment
into confusion,&#8221; the gentleman remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;These sort of people always lose their
heads if any one comes to see them unexpectedly,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
the marchioness responded. &#8220;I suppose
they never visit each other; their houses
are too small.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably it is because they would only
bore each other to death if they did. No one
in the middle classes ever breaks the moral
law, I understand, and so they have nothing
interesting to talk about.&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness frowned severely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Silence! Remember you are on your
good behavior. You are not to shock this
dear, good person.&#8221;</p>

<p>The &#8220;dear, good person&#8221; interrupted the
conversation by his appearance. He advanced
to the marchioness, and shook hands
with so much real regard that her rings were
crushed into the flesh.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m delighted to see your ladyship&mdash;delighted!
It&#8217;s so kind of you to come.&#8221; He
turned to her companion. &#8220;And you, my
lord.&#8221;</p>

<p>In Tooting it is not the custom for married
ladies to drive about paying visits with gentlemen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
other than their husbands or near relations.
The marchioness forced a somewhat
unnatural smile as she explained:</p>

<p>&#8220;Er&mdash;let me&mdash;Mr. Despencer, a friend of
mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>A look of hopeless bewilderment appeared
on the alderman&#8217;s speaking countenance.
Despencer skilfully put in:</p>

<p>&#8220;A friend of Mr. Hammond&#8217;s as well. The
marchioness thought it better for me to come
here with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tension was relieved. Alderman Dobbin
seated himself facing his visitors, while
the marchioness opened the conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have taken the liberty of coming here,
Mr. Dobbin, without waiting till you came to
my house, because I wanted to have a private
chat with you. You know how difficult it is
to get five minutes&#8217; conversation with any one
in those crushes.&#8221;</p>

<p>The alderman bowed, much gratified at
being supposed to know anything whatever
on the subject.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>&#8220;Of course, what I am going to say to you
is in confidence,&#8221; the marchioness proceeded.
&#8220;I am sure you would not dream of mentioning
to Mr. Hammond that we had been here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not. Your ladyship may trust
me absolutely. Not a soul shall know of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard Mr. Hammond speak of
you so often that I feel you are quite an old
friend. No doubt he has talked of us to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The alderman smiled feebly. He would
have given a good deal to be able to say yes,
but could not quite bring himself to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I ought to say he has talked of
my daughter, Lady Victoria?&#8221;</p>

<p>Alderman Dobbin had never heard of such
a person as Lady Victoria. His smile became
feebler still. The marchioness coughed discreetly,
and glanced towards Despencer. He
came gallantly to the rescue.</p>

<p>&#8220;It has been understood for some time
that Mr. Hammond was likely to marry Lady
Victoria, as, of course, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, of course; quite so,&#8221; jerked out the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
alderman, deeply ashamed of his ignorance
on the point.</p>

<p>The marchioness heaved a sigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;I need not ask if the match had your approval,
Mr. Dobbin, because I am sure that
you, as a friend of Mr. Hammond&#8217;s, must see
what an advantage such a connection would
be to him in his political career.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, your ladyship. Nothing could
be better. It would go a long way in Tooting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! And now, do you know, I am almost
afraid that the idea will have to be abandoned.
I hesitate whether I ought to allow
my daughter to think of Mr. Hammond any
longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me! I am very sorry to hear your
ladyship say that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her ladyship shook her head sadly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I have no doubt you understand
the reason.&#8221;</p>

<p>The alderman&#8217;s face again clearly betraying
that he had not the remotest idea of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
the reason, Despencer came to his assistance
once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;The marchioness refers to Mr. Hammond&#8217;s
attentions to this music-hall singer,
Belle Yorke.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alderman Dobbin sat horror-struck. He
was not acquainted with Belle Yorke by
name, but of music-hall singers as a class
his ideas could only have been expressed in
language severely Biblical. The marchioness
hastened to drive the nail home.</p>

<p>&#8220;All his friends must share the same feelings
about this unfortunate attachment,&#8221; she
observed, in a tone of sympathetic condolence.
&#8220;What effect, in your opinion, Mr. Dobbin,
would his marrying a girl of that kind have
on his position here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He would never get in for Tooting again.
The Liberals have got a very strong candidate&mdash;Sir
Thomas Huggins, a baronet. I
dare say your ladyship knows him?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her ladyship was not quite sure whether
she had met Sir Thomas Huggins.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>&#8220;His social influence here is very strong.
His wife, Lady Huggins, gives a garden-party
every summer, and many Primrose
Dames go to it. We are beginning to be
afraid for the seat, as it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you consider, speaking as a judge
of the political situation, that if Mr. Hammond
were to marry beneath him, instead of
making such a match as it is in his power to
do, it would seriously affect his prospects?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be fatal to them, my lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness looked up at the ceiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a pity he has no wise and candid
friend to point this out to him, and remonstrate
with him on behalf of the&mdash;er&mdash;the
party!&#8221;</p>

<p>Curiously enough, there was just such a
wise and candid friend in the room ready
and willing to undertake the task.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your ladyship may leave it to me,&#8221; said
the eager alderman. &#8220;I will take it on myself
to point out to Mr. Hammond the&mdash;the&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Political situation,&#8221; suggested Despencer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>The marchioness threw a smile of admiration
at the wise and candid friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;The very thing!&#8221; she exclaimed, with a
fine assumption of having been taken entirely
by surprise. &#8220;No one else could do this so
well. I have no doubt that a few judicious
words from you will be sufficient to open Mr.
Hammond&#8217;s eyes. Ahem! Have the&mdash;er&mdash;the
rumors about this young woman reached
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What rumors, my lady? I haven&#8217;t heard
anything about her.&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness raised her eyebrows, and
then appealed by an eloquent look to Mr. Despencer.
Despencer shook his head with the
air of a good man whose righteous soul was
vexed by the bare recollection of others&#8217; iniquity.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see you don&#8217;t know the worst,&#8221; he remarked,
gravely. &#8220;If there were nothing
more against Miss Yorke than the mere fact
of her being on the music-hall stage it would
not matter so much. But&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>Another head-shake completed the sentence,
and told the horrified alderman far
more than any words could have done.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor girl! let us hope it is not all true,&#8221;
murmured the marchioness, with Christian
compassion.</p>

<p>A minute or two later she rose to go. The
alderman, aware from sundry creaking
sounds overhead that his wife was hurrying
through a frantic toilet up-stairs, remonstrated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t your ladyship stay and have a cup
of tea? I expect Mrs. Dobbin to come in every
minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am <i>so</i> sorry. I particularly wish to
make Mrs. Dobbin&#8217;s acquaintance, but I am
afraid I cannot stay another moment. Some
other day, if you will allow me, I hope to come
out and call on her. But you see this is quite
a confidential visit. What a charming situation
you have here! Quite rural, I declare!
It reminds me of our place in Worcestershire.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Despencer added his testimony that it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
was very like the Marquis of Severn&#8217;s place
in Worcestershire&mdash;indeed it was, for there
were grass and laurel-bushes in both.</p>

<p>The visitors tore themselves away at last,
and disappeared, a vision of varnished panels
and gleaming harness and tossing horses&#8217;
heads and flying dust. And what did Alderman
Dobbin do when they were gone?</p>

<p>He did what every other well-conducted
alderman in his situation would have done.
He went forth into the town and bought a
peerage.</p>

<p>Then he shut himself up in his counting-house,
and sat down to write a letter.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">SCENE VI<br />


<small>WHAT PEOPLE SAID</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Mr. Hammond!</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus proclaimed the machine stationed
outside the door of the principal drawing-room
in Berkeley Square. It was the night
of the marchioness&#8217;s concert, and a stream
of splendidly clad dames, rustling in silk and
velvet, and flashing in pearls and diamonds,
and of meanly clad men, disguised as waiters,
except for an occasional red or blue ribbon,
slightly suggestive of that worn by a
pet cat, was flowing up the stairs, and through
the doorway, where the machine checked
them off one by one like an automatic turnstile.
And the proclamations were by no
means a mere empty ceremony, for without
them the marchioness would have been quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
ignorant of the names of at least half of those
with whom she was shaking hands on the
other side of the threshold.</p>

<p>The hygienic regulations by which every
Board-School child is entitled to a fixed number
of cubic feet of space do not apply to the
guests of marchionesses, and it was becoming
difficult to move through the concert-room
without inflicting physical injury on
others. The wiser of the late arrivals, or
those more familiar with the locality, backed
out as soon as they had mumbled the
necessary formula of greeting to their hostess,
and took refuge in a smaller drawing-room,
where the Lady Victoria was holding
a levee of her own particular friends. It
was to this room that Hammond made his
way after bowing over the marchioness&#8217;s
hand.</p>

<p>Directly he lifted the curtain which screened
the open doorway, Lady Victoria, clad in
white, with a string of turquoise forget-me-nots
round her bared neck, deserted a group<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
of half a dozen other admirers, and came
towards him with a frankness which would
have jarred harshly on her mother&#8217;s notions
of finesse.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is right, Mr. Hammond. I am so
glad you have come into this room. It is
cool, it is comfortable, and, what is better,
you can&#8217;t hear a note of the music.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have forgotten to mention that you
are in this room,&#8221; replied Hammond. &#8220;But
I share your views about the music. If we
have got to pretend to enjoy art, why can&#8217;t
it be painting or poetry, or something that
won&#8217;t positively annoy us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t do for my mother to hear me,&#8221;
said Victoria, &#8220;but I may as well confess to
you that I have absolutely no accomplishments.
I don&#8217;t play the violin, I don&#8217;t model
in clay, and I don&#8217;t even write answers to
questions on etiquette in the <i>Young Ladies&#8217;
Journal</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely you kodak?&#8221; Hammond pleaded.</p>

<p>Before Lady Victoria could clear herself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
from the charge, the voice of the machine
sounded through the curtain:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>The Dean of Colchester!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond turned pale.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whatever is the dean doing here?&#8221; he
gasped.</p>

<p>Victoria shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;My mother likes to have the higher clergy
at her parties. She thinks their costume
gives variety.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whenever I meet that man he asks me
for a subscription,&#8221; Hammond was beginning,
when the dean himself, forewarned by some
preternatural intuition, turned aside from the
reception-room and came through the curtain.</p>

<p>A glad light beamed out on his face as he
bore down upon the pair.</p>

<p>&#8220;And how is Lady Victoria? I need not
ask. Mr. Hammond, this is fortunate!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond gave a smile, like that of Mr.
Charles Hawtrey on the stage when his stage
mother-in-law enters and announces that she
has come to spend a stage-day with him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>&#8220;How much this time, dean?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Dean of Colchester drew back; then
he put his head on one side and smiled indulgently
on his victim.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is too bad, isn&#8217;t he?&#8221; This was to
Lady Victoria. &#8220;But, do you know, I really
was going to write to you this week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How much?&#8221; Hammond repeated, drearily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lady Victoria, I appeal to you. I am
sure you must think me quite mercenary.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t you better tell him?&#8221; suggested
the matter-of-fact Victoria.</p>

<p>The dean shook his head in protest.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am actually silenced. The fact is that
we are just raising a fund to restore the north
tower of the Cathedral, and I thought that,
as you had been so generous before, you
might possibly see your way to give us some
assistance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How much?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, really! But if you did feel disposed
to do something, however small&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>The voice of the machine was again heard
in the offing:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Mr. Septimus Jones!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better make haste,&#8221; said Victoria
to the dean.</p>

<p>The dean cast an imploring look at Hammond.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am so ashamed! May I really throw
myself on your generosity?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How much?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t possibly&mdash;&#8221; The curtain was
lifted from outside. &#8220;Well, fifty pounds?&#8221;
Hammond took out a pocket-book and began
to scribble a memorandum in it. &#8220;This is
too good of you. I assure you I never expected
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The curtain had admitted a pale youth,
with light-colored hair, parted in the middle,
who held a pair of gloves furtively in one
hand, having plainly just made the discovery
that no one else had brought gloves, and being
distracted in consequence by a desire to
smuggle them into a pocket unperceived.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>Victoria greeted him with suspicious cordiality.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is too bad of you to come so late, Mr.
Jones. I haven&#8217;t enjoyed myself a bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Lady Victoria, you mustn&#8217;t blame
me.&#8221; At this point he made an effort to slip
the hand which contained the gloves into a
tail-pocket, but catching the unconscious eye
of the dean fixed, as he supposed, on the
offending articles, he drew them out again
hastily. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t get here sooner. My
brougham wasn&#8217;t ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You should have come in a cab.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Lady Victoria, I am sure you don&#8217;t
mean that I could have come in a horrid cab.
I would as soon walk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you ride a bicycle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, Lady Victoria, of course I ride
a bicycle&mdash;in the morning, in the Park, you
know, but not in the streets. You don&#8217;t mean
that I could have come here on a bicycle, do
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time he had dexterously transferred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
the gloves to his other hand, and was again
cautiously feeling his way round to his coat-tails,
when a sudden movement of Hammond&#8217;s,
who had just completed his business
with the dean, caused the unfortunate youth
to take fright and once more relinquish his
half-executed design.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid you are not in earnest, Mr.
Jones.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, Lady Victoria, I am very earnest.
Everybody says I am very earnest. I take
life quite seriously&mdash;I do, indeed. I go to
all sorts of lectures and that kind of thing,
you know, to improve my mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will have to be careful, then,&#8221; put in
Hammond as he came up, &#8220;or they will make
you give them a testimonial, and advertise
you in all the papers as a marvellous cure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Jones shrank back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, now, Hammond, I am afraid of you,
because you are so sarcastic. He was sarcastic
then, wasn&#8217;t he, Lady Victoria?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not very,&#8221; replied the person appealed to.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
The next instant she gave an imperceptible
start.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Captain Mauleverer!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if you two are going to quarrel I
shall go into the next room,&#8221; Victoria went
on, quickly, beginning to move away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no, Lady Victoria,&#8221; Mr. Jones remonstrated;
&#8220;I never quarrel. I am a subscriber
to the Peace Society&mdash;I really am.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Dean of Colchester looked round.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I can leave you in perfect safety,&#8221;
retorted Victoria, gliding off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me! I am afraid that Lady Victoria
is sarcastic, too,&#8221; Mr. Jones observed,
sagaciously, looking after her. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you
think so, Hammond?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have suspected her of it sometimes; but
she never admits it, and it is so difficult to
prove these things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will ask the dean; I am sure he is not
sarcastic&mdash;are you, dean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear fellow,&#8221; Hammond interrupted,
&#8220;I am surprised that you should ask such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
question. A sarcastic dean would be a moral
outrage. You might as well speak of a malicious
cathedral.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dean thought of his fifty pounds, and
smiled like an early Christian martyr commencing
an interview with a sharp-set lion.</p>

<p>At this point Hammond&#8217;s attention was
diverted by the entrance of the latest arrival.
As he turned away to greet him, the dean
laid a caressing hand on Mr. Jones&#8217;s arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did I hear you say just now that you
were a subscriber to&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Jones gave a glance round. He was
alone with the dean, and the dean was on
the wrong side of him. There was no human
eye to see the deed. With one swift
movement he succeeded in depositing his
gloves in their long-sought hiding-place,
and then suffered himself to fall an unresisting
prey to the north tower of the Colchester
Cathedral.</p>

<p>Captain Mauleverer&#8217;s face wore a decidedly
cross expression as he came into the room.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
At the sight of Hammond it lighted up, and
the two shook hands like old friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you patronize my aunt&#8217;s menagerie?&#8221;
the captain observed, disrespectfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should have thought you had too much
sense.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear fellow, you are here yourself,&#8221;
returned Hammond.</p>

<p>The captain gave an impatient shrug.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know, but I shouldn&#8217;t be if I could help
it. It&#8217;s a beastly bore. You can&#8217;t smoke,
and you can&#8217;t drink, and you are expected
to sit beside some sentimental woman of
fifty and let her gush to you over some beastly
novel you haven&#8217;t read, and wouldn&#8217;t understand
if you had.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond shook his head with a reproving
smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but you should remember that we
are not here to please ourselves. We are
here to please society.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should you care about society?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
You&#8217;re not a damned pauper like me. You
have everything you want.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one on the face of the earth has everything
he wants,&#8221; Hammond retorted. &#8220;But
I see what it is; you are out of sorts. What&#8217;s
the matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mauleverer&#8217;s only answer was a despairing
shrug.</p>

<p>&#8220;Been backing a horse?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s not that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, then? Cards?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not drink?&#8221; in a tone of incredulity.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain hesitated for a moment before
he gave the answer:</p>

<p>&#8220;Girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond let a mild exclamation of
surprise escape him. Then he looked
at his friend with a certain air of sympathy.</p>

<p>&#8220;What should you say if I were to tell you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
that you and I were in the same boat, old
man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You?&#8221; The other stared at him in amazement.
&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to say that there
is any girl in England who would refuse
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose there were a girl whom I hadn&#8217;t
the courage to ask, not because I was afraid
of her refusing me, but because I was afraid
of her accepting me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose I had to choose between her and
my ambition? Suppose I knew that if I were
to ask her to be my wife I might have to abandon
my whole career, because society would
forbid the banns?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never thought of that,&#8221; murmured his
friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;This very morning,&#8221; Hammond went on,
&#8220;I had a letter from a man who thinks he is
acting in my interests to warn me against the
woman I love.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is rather rough on you, old man.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>Hammond smiled bitterly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, even a damned millionaire can&#8217;t
have everything he wants.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Miss Yorke!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>The name caused a sensation. Heads
were turned from all directions, and the
Dean of Colchester and his victim hurried
back to the neighborhood of the doorway
where Hammond and Mauleverer were standing.
At the same time Mr. Despencer slipped
in from the next room, and stealthily approached
the group.</p>

<p>&#8220;What Miss Yorke is that?&#8221; asked Mauleverer,
innocently.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>The</i> Miss Yorke, I believe, popularly
known as Belle Yorke,&#8221; Despencer took it
on himself to answer. He affected to
keep his eyes turned away from Hammond.</p>

<p>&#8220;Belle Yorke!&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Septimus
Jones, with enthusiasm. &#8220;Oh, I dote upon
her! I think she is perfectly lovely&mdash;don&#8217;t
you, Hammond?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Dean of Colchester gave a sound like
an ecclesiastical purr.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, this is very fortunate! I have so
often wished to see her, but, of course, I
daren&#8217;t go to those places where she
sings. It is so thoughtful of the marchioness
to bring her here. Ahem! isn&#8217;t
there something or other <i>said</i> about
her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They say plenty of things about her, but
God knows how much of it is true,&#8221; remarked
Mauleverer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but Mauleverer,&#8221; Mr. Jones burst in,
&#8220;you know when people say so much it must
be some of it true, mustn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond turned and looked at the three
men, one after the other, and then his eyes
wandered to Despencer, who was standing
by, with a sneer on his thin lips. Here
were these four men all looking at the matter
from different points of view, none of
them apparently with any reason to wish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
ill to Belle Yorke, two of them evidently
friendly towards her, and yet they all doubted
her alike.</p>

<p>Before he could speak he saw a sudden
change come over their faces. A man had
just come hurriedly through the doorway
leading from the reception-room. It was the
Marquis of Severn; and he was in full dress,
with the blue ribbon of the Garter across his
shirt-front. He caught sight of his nephew,
and strode up to him, his face working with
emotion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, Gerald, come this way; I want to
speak to you!&#8221; he exclaimed, without heeding
the presence of the others.</p>

<p>He seized Mauleverer&#8217;s arm, and half led,
half thrust him out of the room. One or two
of the by-standers saw what was happening,
and smiled. Hammond turned sharply on
Despencer, whose smile was peculiarly malicious.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be obliged if you can come
with me into the conservatory for five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
minutes. I wish to speak to you privately,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>Despencer bowed with an air of bland unconcern,
and followed him, while the voice
outside sounded again:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Alderman Dobbin!</i>&#8221;</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">SCENE VII<br />


<small>A QUESTION OF CHEMISTRY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> order to reach the conservatory Hammond
and Despencer had to thread their way
through the concert-room. But their task
was rendered easier by the fact that Belle
Yorke was just standing up to sing. The
mob, attracted partly by her reputation as a
singer, and partly by the story in circulation
about her and their host, whose hurried exit
on her appearance had not gone unremarked,
were crowding towards that end of the saloon
where the piano stood, and thus the two men
were able to make their way round the wall
at the deserted end.</p>

<p>As Hammond had anticipated, they found
the conservatory empty. It was little more
than a long, narrow balcony, roofed over with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
glass, and running along the side of the
house.</p>

<p>Hammond was the first to reach it, but he
stood back to allow Despencer to enter. Despencer
walked past him after a deprecating
shrug and bow, and then turned to meet his
questioner, who came in quickly, shutting
the door behind them.</p>

<p>For a moment the two men stood face to
face, scrutinizing each other like two duellists
who are uncertain of each other&#8217;s play.
Hammond&#8217;s gaze was stern and threatening.
Despencer&#8217;s, equally unflinching, was that of
a man who does not quite know what is required
of him, but has nothing to fear or to
conceal.</p>

<p>The situation was exactly what he had
foreseen and desired. His former reference
to Belle Yorke had had the appearance of
being accidental. He had been far too clever
to seek to press it home at the time. Now,
if Hammond himself chose to revive the subject
of his own accord, anything that Despencer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
might say would appear to be dragged
out of him against his will. He felt perfectly
satisfied with his play, so far. He still
held all his best cards in reserve, and he
had thrown the lead into his adversary&#8217;s
hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what is the mystery?&#8221; he said, lightly,
after waiting some time for Hammond to
speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to ask you for some explanation
of what you said the other afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Despencer was mildly amazed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did I say? I really don&#8217;t remember,&#8221;
he murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;About Miss Yorke. You referred to
some story about her&mdash;some report connecting
her name with Lord Severn&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>Despencer drew back; his manner became
reproachful.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but, my dear sir, you must see that
that was pure inadvertence on my part. I
was not to know that the lady was a friend
of yours.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>It was impossible to quarrel with a man who
showed himself so perfectly polite and, at the
same time, so perfectly indifferent. Hammond&#8217;s
tone lost some of its hostility.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is not the point. Till you spoke, I
had never heard of the existence of this&mdash;slander.&#8221;
The momentary hesitation before
the word did not escape the watchful Despencer.
&#8220;You have spoken, fortunately or
unfortunately, and, now I have heard of it, I
cannot rest till I know more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that necessary?&#8221;</p>

<p>The tone in which the question was put
made it a friendly remonstrance, as much as
if Despencer had said: &#8220;My dear fellow, you
want to think well of this woman. Why
persist in making me undeceive you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond felt the implied warning in all
its force. Nevertheless he answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is necessary. The matter cannot
end like this; I have a motive for pursuing
it. You heard what those other men said
when Miss Yorke was announced. I must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
be able to satisfy myself that this statement
is without foundation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Despencer could not quite resist a sneer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think that was easy enough.
You have only to ask the lady if she knows
Lord Severn.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond frowned impatiently as he said,
aloud, but rather to himself than to Despencer:</p>

<p>&#8220;And what will be her answer?&#8221;</p>

<p>Despencer smiled compassionately.</p>

<p>&#8220;Judging from my own experience in such
cases, I should say that the lady&#8217;s answer
would be &#8216;No.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>For a minute Hammond stood irresolute.
Despencer&#8217;s sneer had shown him where he
stood. Instead of silencing a slanderer, he
was discussing the truth of the slander with
the man who had uttered it. If he had really
had confidence in the woman he had undertaken
to defend, it was to her, not to this
cynical stranger, that he ought to have been
addressing his inquiries. He felt bitterly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
conscious of his false position, yet he could
not resist going on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did you hear this rumor?&#8221; he
asked, after a brief pause, during which
Despencer had closely watched every shade
of expression on his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can hardly tell you, I have heard it from
so many quarters,&#8221; was the careless reply.
&#8220;I thought everybody knew it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean by that that everybody believes
it?&#8221; demanded Hammond.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; but that is no reason why you
should, if you would rather not. Take my
advice, treat it as a mere passing calumny,
and forget all about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond glanced at him questioningly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you, Despencer&mdash;of course, you believe
this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, yes; but I shall be happy to withdraw
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Despencer&#8217;s mocking smile was lost upon
Hammond. He muttered:</p>

<p>&#8220;I must get at the truth.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>&#8220;Far better not,&#8221; observed the cynic. &#8220;The
truth is sometimes very disagreeable. I myself
much prefer to be told pleasant falsehoods.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And to tell them, I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>Despencer did not wince.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am always anxious to oblige,&#8221; he answered,
pointedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have no prejudice against Miss
Yorke?&#8221; was Hammond&#8217;s next question.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no prejudices at all, I can assure
you. I am a most broad-minded person.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would make no difference to you, I suppose,
if this report were true? It wouldn&#8217;t injure
her in your opinion?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contrary, it would greatly increase
my respect for her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond seemed to be trying to sound
the depths of his companion&#8217;s character.</p>

<p>&#8220;I congratulate you. But you wouldn&#8217;t
marry her?&#8221;</p>

<p>Despencer drew back, and shook his head
with an amused air.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>&#8220;Oh no! I am afraid I am not broad-minded
enough for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t outrage decency, you know.
Society would think me worse than the marquis.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Damn society!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it is damned already,&#8221; said Despencer,
quickly. &#8220;But even down below there
are certain regulations which must be respected.
There is an etiquette of Pandemonium.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond gave him another thoughtful
look.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a very clever man, Despencer,
but, do you know, you almost make immorality
tedious. If you are not careful, people
will begin to get bored by vice, and virtue
will become the fashion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is not a bad idea. There is always
something attractive in novelty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Hammond reflected for a minute,
and again he resumed his questioning.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>&#8220;Tell me, has the marchioness heard this
rumor?&#8221;</p>

<p>Despencer had not been expecting this
question, and it nearly threw him off his
guard. His eye met Hammond&#8217;s for a moment
before he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should hardly think so, or she wouldn&#8217;t
have had her here. That would have been
too daring, even for her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be equally daring for her to
come here if there were anything in it. Surely
her very presence here proves her innocence?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; but what about Lord Severn&#8217;s absence?
You saw him hurry out the moment
she arrived?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My God, yes!&#8221; The words were dragged
from Hammond in a burst of anguish.
&#8220;There is some damned mystery in this!&#8221;
he muttered between his teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, it may be a mere coincidence,&#8221;
the tempter threw in, artfully. &#8220;But I am always
so suspicious of coincidences.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>Hammond was not listening. A new idea
had occurred to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a great mind to go to Severn himself,
and put myself in his hands. But, then,
of course, one couldn&#8217;t trust him,&#8221; he added,
regretfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is a man of honor,&#8221; objected the
other.</p>

<p>&#8220;And when the good name of a woman is
at stake, men of honor always lie,&#8221; was the
stern retort. &#8220;Oh would to Heaven you had
either never told me this, or else proved it up
to the very hilt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t speak out of any zeal for morality,
you may be sure. I had simply heard
the common talk, and I naturally assumed
that it was true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>Despencer gave a delicate, self-satisfied
smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;When there is any doubt, I always believe
the worst. I find I am seldom wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond stepped back, with an indignant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
gesture. He was beginning to feel ashamed
of the discussion.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you can stand like that and smile
away a reputation!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;I wonder
what they made you of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe a chemical analysis of me would
yield the ordinary results,&#8221; returned Despencer,
with unruffled composure. &#8220;I rather
think that hydrogen is the principal ingredient.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond gave a short laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Despencer, I begin actually to respect you.
It can be no easy thing to attain to such a
height of perfect brutality as yours. You
must have taken great pains with yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may say what you like, Hammond,
as long as you are not violent. I always
draw the line at violence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you have to draw it often?&#8221;</p>

<p>Even the trained and admirable temper of
Despencer gave way under this taunt, and a
red flush suffused his pale cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hammond, do you mean to be insulting?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>&#8220;Why, do you mind much? I should have
thought the hydrogen would have stood it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The words were drowned in a sudden crash
of music and hand-clapping as the door behind
them opened, and Captain Mauleverer
came through with Belle Yorke on his arm.</p>

<p>Despencer drew to one side with a bow
as they approached.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, captain, taking Lord Severn&#8217;s place,
I see,&#8221; he remarked, with a sarcastic emphasis
intended for Hammond&#8217;s ear, and passed
back into the concert-room.</p>

<p>Mauleverer stared after him as if he had
been some noxious animal.</p>

<p>&#8220;What has that damned cad&mdash;beg pardon,
Miss Yorke&mdash;been doing here?&#8221; he demanded
of Hammond.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, only taking away some one&#8217;s character.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not mine, I hope,&#8221; said Belle, with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not in Hammond&#8217;s hearing, I&#8217;ll
swear,&#8221; said the loyal captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was too bad of you to go outside just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
as I was going to sing,&#8221; said Belle to the
silent Hammond. &#8220;I shall expect an explanation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been waiting here to give it to
you,&#8221; was the grave answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem quite serious about it. I am
sure Mr. Despencer has been saying something
against me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Mauleverer put in a word.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t let you give your explanation
now, because Miss Yorke has promised to
sit out this next piece with me. You must
wait your turn, old fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What does Miss Yorke say?&#8221; asked the
other.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say what they say at the libraries about
the book of the season. You shall have me
when the captain has done with me.&#8221; She
turned merrily to the captain. &#8220;But you
mustn&#8217;t skip, you know. I shall allow you
fourteen minutes for perusal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to read you through,&#8221; said Hammond.
And he went out.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">SCENE VIII<br />


<small>CINDERELLA</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">How</span> very sober Mr. Hammond seems
to-night! I hope he isn&#8217;t going to be
cross.&#8221;</p>

<p>Though she spoke gayly enough, a vague
sense of ill was stealing over her. She sat
down on a low cane settee, over which flowering
shrubs made a sort of canopy, and a sadness
seemed to breathe in the heavy scent of
tuberose and stephanotis.</p>

<p>Captain Mauleverer placed himself beside
her, and looked at her with a certain respectful
pity as he answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t likely. I&#8217;m sure it wouldn&#8217;t be
easy to be cross with you, Miss Yorke.&#8221;</p>

<p>Belle detected something in his voice which
increased her foreboding.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>&#8220;You look as grave as Mr. Hammond. Is
anything the matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m afraid there is.&#8221;</p>

<p>The moment he had spoken the words he
wished them unuttered. The light faded out
of the beautiful eyes, and a pathetic sadness
took its place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, please don&#8217;t tell me that!&#8221; she pleaded.
&#8220;I am enjoying myself so much this
evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you? I am glad of that,&#8221; said
Mauleverer, tugging uneasily at his mustache.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I have never been to a place like
this before, you know, and it is all so strange
and beautiful. I am a little bit afraid of the
Marchioness of Severn, but every one else has
been so kind that I haven&#8217;t felt myself a
stranger. I feel almost like the little chimney-sweep
who wandered by accident into
the state bedroom of the castle, and turned
out to be the rightful heir. Please don&#8217;t send
me back to my chimney.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>The captain swallowed something in his
throat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I hadn&#8217;t promised to, but the fact
is I have undertaken to give you a message.&#8221;</p>

<p>This time Belle turned to him with a look
of something like alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you put it off till to-morrow? Do
let me have my dream out to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mauleverer shook himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hang it! I have a great mind to,&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please do, if it is an unkind message. I
didn&#8217;t think I had any enemies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have none&mdash;at least, I don&#8217;t believe
you have. It isn&#8217;t that. What I have promised
to tell you is something about yourself,
something you ought to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Something about myself! Oh, what do
you mean? I haven&#8217;t been doing anything
wrong, have I?&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Mauleverer bit his lip and looked
more than half inclined to run away. Then
he said, slowly:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>&#8220;Perhaps I should have said&mdash;something
about your father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My father!&#8221; She gazed at him in astonishment.
&#8220;But he is dead! He died before
I was born.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221;</p>

<p>The answer struck her dumb. She sat
still and pressed her hand against her heart.
The man replied to her unspoken questions
with a grave shake of the head.</p>

<p>&#8220;My father is not dead? Oh, Captain
Mauleverer, what are you saying? What
do you know about him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I didn&#8217;t have to speak to you like
this. Your father is alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And they have always told me he was
dead! My mother&mdash; Captain Mauleverer,
are you <i>sure</i> of what you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am. I know your father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why&mdash;&#8221; She broke off in the midst
of the question and wrung her hands. &#8220;Ah!
I begin to understand. My father has done
something that has made them hide his existence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
from me. And you are going to tell me
what it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;well, I promised that I would.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave a half-sob.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may go on now. I find that I am
only the little chimney-sweeper after all. But
stay!&#8221; A fresh thought struck her with overwhelming
force. &#8220;Perhaps this is some mistake
after all. You say my father is alive,
but did you know that my mother had been
married again?&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain clenched his fists.</p>

<p>&#8220;God forgive me&mdash;I <i>can&#8217;t</i> tell you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then&mdash;then there is only one explanation,
Captain Mauleverer.&#8221; She hid her
face in her hands for a minute, and then
raised it again and looked him bravely
in the face. &#8220;Is that it? Tell me the
truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mauleverer sprang from his seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m damned if I do!&#8221;</p>

<p>A burst of music and a babble of tongues
told them that the door had opened again,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
and some one else was coming in. It was the
Marchioness of Severn, and she was alone.</p>

<p>Belle rose from her seat dry-eyed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Miss Yorke, they told me I should
find you here. That will do, Gerald. Miss
Yorke and I are going to have a little talk.
Pray sit down again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Belle resumed her seat in silence, with an
inward dread of what was in store for her
next, while Captain Mauleverer walked off
with the hang-dog air of a man who feels
he has made a brute of himself.</p>

<p>The marchioness sat down beside her guest.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have to thank you for a most delightful
evening. You sang most charmingly. I almost
wish I hadn&#8217;t asked you for that one
called &#8216;Little Willy,&#8217; though. I am so sensitive.
You almost made me cry&mdash;you did,
indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Belle stole a timid glance at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is very kind of you to praise me so
much. That song of mine has always been
a favorite.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wonder at it. Dear, sweet little
thing, freezing to death like that! Why
didn&#8217;t some one give him a seal-skin jacket?
And do you really sing things like that at
those dreadful places in Leicester Square?&#8221;</p>

<p>Belle began to feel uncomfortable. The
patronage it was difficult to resent, but the
hinted disparagement roused her courage.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry you think them dreadful,&#8221;
she said, modestly but quite firmly, &#8220;because,
you know, I have to sing there for my
living.&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness&#8217;s determined good-nature
was not to be turned aside.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no; of course, I ought not to have
called them that before you. But one reads
such shocking things about them in the newspapers
when they apply for their licenses to
the County Council. I&#8217;m sure I hope it isn&#8217;t
half of it true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you won&#8217;t be offended if I stand up
for them,&#8221; Belle persisted, bravely. &#8220;I must
be loyal to my own profession, mustn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>&#8220;Of course! Of course! Most properly. I
hope&mdash;in fact, I am sure, that they have done
you no harm. But I have heard so much
about these places, and the life, that it
makes me feel the very gravest doubt. I
take an interest in you, Miss Yorke, and
I should be so sorry if you were to lower
yourself by your connection with the music-halls.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still bleeding from the wound dealt her
in all respectful kindness by the man who
had been with her just before, Belle roused
herself to ward off the more envenomed
stabs of the woman who was with her
now.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t intend to lower myself, or to let
myself be lowered, by any place I may go
to,&#8221; she said, with dignity, looking the marchioness
in the face.</p>

<p>The marchioness smiled on her like a
mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is right. I am so glad to hear you
say that. But you can&#8217;t be too careful, you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
know. The world is so censorious. Society
has very keen ears for the least whisper
against a woman&#8217;s name.&#8221;</p>

<p>This time Belle realized that there was
some serious purpose beneath her persecutor&#8217;s
moralizing. She turned on her indignantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you don&#8217;t mean that society has
been listening to any whispers against my
name!&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>The marchioness put out her hands with
a soothing gesture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no&mdash;not yet, at all events. Still, as
I say, you cannot be too careful in your unfortunate
position. I thought I ought to take
the opportunity of giving you a friendly warning.
It is so easy to check a thing of this
kind at the outset, but afterwards it may be
too late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid I don&#8217;t understand you yet,&#8221;
said Belle, in a carefully measured voice
which would have betrayed the rising anger
to a duller ear than the Marchioness of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
Severn&#8217;s. &#8220;Do you mean to say that there
is anything for me to check?&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness, becoming slightly nervous,
tried to beat about the bush.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no; I won&#8217;t go so far as that. I don&#8217;t
put it in that way&mdash;merely a possibility, that
is all. Of course, it is very natural that the
men who go to such places should admire
you, with your voice and figure; only don&#8217;t
let one particular man admire you more openly
than the rest. You understand me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Belle&#8217;s voice became cold and metallic.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean that there is some one whose
name has been associated with mine as an
admirer more than the rest?&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness bowed and smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is just it. You have put it very
nicely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I ask you to tell me his name?&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness threw a glance of mild
reproach at her young friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely, my dear Miss Yorke, you must
know that! Every one tells me that his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
attentions have been most marked&mdash;Mr.
Hammond.&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness brought out the name
with a jerk, watching her victim keenly the
while. But Belle gave her no assurance, by
so much as the flutter of an eyelid, that the
shaft had gone home.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Hammond&#8217;s attentions to me have
always been perfectly respectful.&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness positively bubbled over
with shame at the implied suggestion that
she had thought otherwise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course! Naturally! But you <i>know</i>,
my dear girl, that society will take a <i>very</i>
different view. Society is <i>so</i> incredulous. It
<i>never</i> believes that a man&#8217;s friendship for a
woman is perfectly respectful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not when he asks her to become his wife?&#8221;
Belle could not resist the question.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is quite different.&#8221; The marchioness
suddenly became the great lady. &#8220;We
are not talking of that, as you know. Mr.
Hammond is not one of those foolish young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
men who marry a girl out of their own class
and regret it ever afterwards. You must put
that idea out of your head at once, believe
me. I am speaking as your friend and as
a woman of the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>Belle looked at her friend for a moment
with a silence that had something satirical
in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is Mr. Hammond&#8217;s class?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know? Mr. Hammond is a
millionaire. He moves in the very best society.
He could marry almost any woman
in England, except royalty. I know dukes,
even, who would feel honored by an alliance
with Mr. Hammond.&#8221;</p>

<p>All this time it had not occurred to Belle,
in her simplicity, that she could possibly be
regarded by the great lady beside her as a
rival, and a dangerous rival, to her own
daughter. She only felt that something
very dear to her was at stake, and she wrestled
for it blindly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that simply because he is rich?&#8221; she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
demanded, with the scorn which youth always
feels for wealth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not entirely,&#8221; the marchioness answered,
mildly, &#8220;though, of course, that has a great
deal to do with it. But Mr. Hammond comes
of a most respectable family, I believe. I
have heard that his father was quite a gentleman
towards the end of his life. And then
he has a fine political career before him; he
is in Parliament, and may be in the Cabinet.
You can&#8217;t expect him to throw all that away
to marry you, my dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>Belle began to fear that she was going to be
beaten.</p>

<p>&#8220;And would he? Would it be such a very
great disgrace?&#8221; she murmured below her
breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> don&#8217;t say that it would,&#8221; replied her
deeply sympathizing friend; &#8220;but society
would consider it so. You see, we can none
of us do all that we like. There are many
things that I should like to do, but I dare not.
We all feel inclined to rebel sometimes and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
gratify our own inclinations, but we are restrained
by a higher law.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What higher law is there than the loyal
instinct of our own hearts?&#8221; demanded Belle,
with a flash of indignation.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear, the prejudices of society! Its
feelings must be respected. We have to mould
our lives accordingly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why? Why should we obey such a code?
Why should we cringe to this bogie you call
society? Why should we make ourselves
slaves to one another&#8217;s shadows?&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness drew herself up and regarded
her young friend with real pain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Yorke, you quite surprise me. I am
shocked to hear you use such language. Do
you realize what you are saying? You called
society a bogie!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was wrong. It is something more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is true that its dictates sometimes appear
harsh and unreasonable, but that is the
same for all of us. Why should you expect to
be an exception to the rule more than others?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>&#8220;Shall I tell you?&#8221; All the bitterness of
her newly acquired knowledge rang out in
Belle&#8217;s voice. &#8220;Because I am one of the victims
of society; because it placed its brand
upon me before ever I was born. Society has
made me an outlaw, and therefore I owe it no
allegiance, and I will give it none. You tell
me that because I am a public singer I have
no right to the friendship of an honorable
man; that there are whispers in circulation
against my name already. Let them whisper!
I have done with all that. I shall not
abandon my friends at society&#8217;s bidding, and
I won&#8217;t give up the man I love because it tells
me&mdash;I won&#8217;t do it!&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness rose, deeply shocked and
grieved.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, I can&#8217;t stay here&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the sudden loudness of the sounds
from the concert-room. Again the door stood
open, and John Hammond in the doorway.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">SCENE IX<br />


<small>AND THE PRINCE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> moment she saw who had come into
the conservatory the marchioness sat down
again promptly, and with a decision which
spoke volumes for her intention to remain.</p>

<p>Hammond advanced, and recognized the
marchioness with a look of wonder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is Mauleverer?&#8221; he inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;I sent Gerald away,&#8221; replied the marchioness,
with an intonation which plainly added:
&#8220;And I should like to send you away, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was considerate of you,&#8221; retorted
Hammond, with a pleasant smile.</p>

<p>There was a vacant space on the seat between
the two women, and he took possession
of it with a cool deliberateness which appeared
to cause the marchioness some dismay.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>&#8220;I wanted to have a little private chat with
Miss Yorke,&#8221; she observed, stiffly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The very thing I wanted, too. You have
done me out of my turn, hasn&#8217;t she, Miss
Yorke? You are positively quite a cuckoo,
my dear marchioness.&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness made a painful effort to
smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not at all sure that I shall allow you
to speak to Miss Yorke,&#8221; she responded, trying
to look past him at Belle herself.</p>

<p>On Hammond&#8217;s entrance Belle had shrunk
back with a certain apprehension which had
afforded secret satisfaction to her hostess.
She now waited in silence, nervously plucking
at the leaves of a camellia which brushed
her shoulder where she sat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now she is under my roof,&#8221; pursued the
marchioness, &#8220;I feel in the position of her
guardian. I regard you as a very dangerous
character.&#8221;</p>

<p>A smile of bitter irony gleamed for a moment
on Hammond&#8217;s lips.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>&#8220;I rather think you must be right. I don&#8217;t
know why it is, but I am feeling in a peculiarly
lawless mood this evening. If Miss Yorke
were not here, I am not at all sure that your
diamonds would be safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Something in the manner of this speech,
rather than in the words, caused the marchioness
to move several inches farther off
along the settee. It was a distinct shock to
her to hear the Severn diamonds made the
subject of coarse jocularity. The one in the
centre of her bosom had been given to the
first Mauleverer by King John as a reward
for resisting the agitation for Magna Charta.
Those in the tiara above her forehead had
been brought into the family by a left-handed
daughter of John of Gaunt. The value of
the whole was nearly a year&#8217;s income of the
much-mortgaged Severn estates.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, Mr. Hammond, you speak so
strangely that if I didn&#8217;t know you so well I
should think something was the matter with
you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>It was necessary to let her ladyship see
clearly that she was out of place. Hammond
cast on her a look which she had not seen in
his eyes before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know me well? Does any of us
know another well? Don&#8217;t we, most of us,
drift through life with our eyes half closed,
ignorant of our aims, ignorant of our very
natures, till some shock comes to awaken us,
and in the moment of trial we find out for the
first time who and what we really are?&#8221;</p>

<p>A subtle instinct told him, before he had
finished speaking, that his words were being
eagerly followed by the girl who sat on his
right hand. On the marchioness they fell
with something of the effect of a cold spray.
She shivered and got up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, of course, all that is very true,
no doubt,&#8221; she murmured, hastily. &#8220;But I
must really be going back to look after the
people.&#8221; She turned a feline glance on Belle.
&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t sit out here too long if I were you,
Miss Yorke; you may catch cold.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>&#8220;Thank you; I am not afraid of that,&#8221; was
the quiet answer.</p>

<p>The marchioness turned her eyes from one
to the other, pursed up her lips with severity,
and reluctantly retreated.</p>

<p>Hammond watched her exit with a sarcastic
smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid the marchioness believes I
have been drinking,&#8221; he observed.</p>

<p>The cynicism jarred on Belle as harshly as
the seriousness had jarred on the marchioness.
There is no woman who can respond
to a man through all his moods, not even she
who loves him best.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder how much truth there is in what
you said just now?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond turned and fixed an earnest
gaze on her. He saw her for the first time
in his experience with a troubled brow, but
he never guessed the cause. There is no
man who can follow a woman through all her
moods, not even he who loves her best.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is what I wanted to ask you,&#8221; he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
said, in answer to her question. &#8220;We two
have known each other for some time, haven&#8217;t
we; but how much do I know of you, or you
of me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Belle felt what was coming. She saw it
in his eye, she heard it in his voice. Desperately
she resolved to meet it half-way.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been finding that out this evening.
Since I have come here I have understood for
the first time what you are and what I am.
Mr. Hammond, after this evening we must not
meet again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Belle! Why do you say that?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a note of anguish in his voice.
He had been fighting a battle with himself
all this time. It had never occurred to him
that there might be another to overcome besides.</p>

<p>She looked him steadily in the face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you call me Belle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought we were friends,&#8221; he said. But
he blushed as he said it.</p>

<p>&#8220;What kind of friends? Would your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
friendship with Lady Victoria allow you to
call her by her Christian name? Don&#8217;t you
see that the difference between her and me
makes our friendship impossible?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you trust me, then?&#8221; asked the
man.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have no right to ask me for my trust.
You and I belong to different worlds. Where
there is no equality there can be no friendship.
It would have been better if we had never
met.&#8221;</p>

<p>She spoke with a certain rigidity which
baffled him. He did not know that the poor
girl was but repeating the bitter lesson which
had just been taught to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;But why,&#8221; he eagerly demanded&mdash;&#8220;why
should you suddenly take this tone with me?
I was going to ask you for your confidence.
I meant to beg you to let me take your part
against your enemies, and you rebuff me at
the outset like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have I enemies? I didn&#8217;t know that.&#8221;
She spoke with a pathetic resignation. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
had heard too much within the last half-hour
to be much moved by any new disclosure.
&#8220;But there is all the more reason that I should
give them no handle against me. Consider
what society is likely to think of such a
friendship as ours&mdash;you, a public man,
wealthy, ambitious, honored by the world,
with a great career before you, and I a humble
singer, whose very calling makes her
name a mark for every spiteful tongue.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should we be afraid of what society
thinks or says?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can afford to ask that. You are a
man, and can defy society; I am a woman,
and to me its breath means life or death.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond sat silent for a minute; he felt
that all this conversation was insincere. It
was but the preface to what he had come there
to say. How was he to pave the way for the
questions he had resolved to put?</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me,&#8221; he said, earnestly, &#8220;have I ever
given you cause to think of me as other than
an honorable man?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>Belle turned and looked at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; was all she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you let me tell you something&mdash;something
that it may be painful for you to
hear?&#8221;</p>

<p>Belle&#8217;s eyes opened wide. The apprehension
of what was coming shone out in them,
and Hammond, mistaking the meaning of
that apprehension, faltered in his purpose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Speak! What is it?&#8221; she commanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is something which concerns yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Was he going to repeat to her the gossip
at which the marchioness had only hinted,
to tell her to her face that their names had
been joined in the world&#8217;s calumnious
breath? She gazed at him in absolute bewilderment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell it me&mdash;quickly!&#8221; she breathed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am ashamed to repeat such a slander.
Yet, since it is in circulation, it is only right
that you should know it, if only that you may
cause it to be crushed.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>&#8220;Yes; please go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They say&mdash;they pretend&mdash;they connect
your name with&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With yours, sir?&#8221; She sat upright, with
flashing eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great heavens, no!&#8221; He stared back at
her with little less amazement than her own.</p>

<p>She sank slowly down again, the anger in
her face changing to deepest scorn.</p>

<p>&#8220;With whose, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With the Marquis of Severn&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; She started up again in sheer
astonishment. &#8220;Who dares? I have never
seen nor spoken to him in my life!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God!&#8221;</p>

<p>Not till he had heard the denial did the
man realize what a burden it had lifted from
his heart; and yet he believed that he loyally
loved this woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who dares to slander me? Who dares
to smirch my name with falsehoods?&#8221; Come
what might, he should not go away doubting
her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>&#8220;It was that man Despencer who told me
first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you listened to him&mdash;you, an honorable
man, and my friend?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond bowed his head. He thought
he could bear her reproaches now.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on; you can say nothing to me that
I have not said already to myself. I have
been a brute, a fool; I know it. I did give
him the lie once, but his words rankled in
my mind, and I could not rest till I had had
the charge disproved.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you are satisfied, go.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond started and shivered. He had
not heard that tone before; he had not seen
that deeply resolute expression, in which
Belle&#8217;s face was set like stone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, not like this! You will forgive me,
Belle? You must! This lie has tortured me
far worse than you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He might have made the excuse that he
had only repeated the slander for her sake,
and not for the satisfaction of his own doubts.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
But he scorned to stoop to subterfuge with
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should I? Your good opinion or
your friendship are nothing to me any
longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My good opinion&mdash;friendship! Ah, it is
more than that! You know, you must know,
that I have loved you all the time!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So much the worse. For you to speak
of love to me is only another insult.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not mean to insult you,&#8221; was the
humble answer. &#8220;I meant to offer you the
love that a man offers to his betrothed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does a man cast suspicions on his betrothed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not cast suspicions. My worst
fault is to have listened to those of others.
There is no love without jealousy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no love without perfect trust.
If a man really loves a woman, does he set
himself to doubt her, to gather up the malicious
tattle of her enemies, and carry it to her,
like an accusing judge, and ask her to clear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
herself? Ah, no! If he loves her, he first
crushes the slander and the enemy together,
and then comes to tell her what he has done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait! But I cannot expect to be treated
like that. My good name is of no importance
to me; I am public property. There would
be nothing to talk about in the club smoking-rooms
if we poor singers were to be respected.
It is natural that we should be bad. And so
you come to me and repeat the accusations
which you had not the courage to despise.
And that is your love!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I implore you&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! With us poor girls it is different.
We have not your prudence and self-restraint.
Where we love we do not ask for references.
We give our hearts without reserve, and
from the moment we have given them, instead
of searching for stains on the character
of the man we love, we set ourselves to see
only the good in him; we shut our eyes to
the evil; we screen his faults; if others attack<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
him, we defend him; and if the world
casts him out, we cling to him all the more.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her voice sank down and ended in a sob.
Hammond clasped his hands together in despair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did I ever hesitate? I was a coward.
I dreaded the idea of even a whisper being
raised against my wife. Forgive me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you were right. Yes, I forgive you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The answer came softly, and the man&#8217;s
heart was thrilled to the core.</p>

<p>&#8220;And something more,&#8221; he pleaded passionately.
&#8220;Tell me that you love me like
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Belle slowly, gently shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Why do you make it so hard for
me? Leave me, I entreat you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond turned faint.</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not love me, then?&#8221; he gasped.</p>

<p>She gave him a despairing look, and answered
passionately:</p>

<p>&#8220;No! I don&#8217;t love you&mdash;I don&#8217;t love you!&#8221;</p>

<p>He rose up, without another word, and went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
away from her. The next instant, as the
door closed behind him, Belle sank down on
the seat, like a flower whose stem is broken,
and the tears began to come like rain.</p>

<p>A door at the far end of the conservatory
softly opened, and a man stepped through
and came towards her, with his finger on his
lips.</p>

<p>It was the Marquis of Severn.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">SCENE X<br />


<small>&#8220;A MARRIAGE HAS BEEN ARRANGED&#8221;</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> most secluded place in the house in
Berkeley Square was the picture-gallery.
The most secluded spot in the picture-gallery
was the Lovers&#8217; Window.</p>

<p>The gallery itself ran across the back of
the house on the second floor, and was thus
outside the legitimate bounds within which
the concert guests were entitled to wander.
It was approached by a door at each end,
giving on to the staircase, and the walls
were hung with pictures, chiefly of the faded,
washed-out schools of Lawrence and Constable.</p>

<p>The window was a deep and lofty bay,
almost a little room, in the centre of the gallery.
A cushioned seat, like a divan, ran<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
round the bay, and on either side of the
opening hung a thick curtain of dark-purple
velvet.</p>

<p>In this sequestered nook no sound of the
concert going on below could be heard. It
was no doubt for this reason that the Lady
Victoria Mauleverer had come thither, and
was now reclining on the divan, with one
beautiful white elbow resting on the sill of
the open window.</p>

<p>As it happened, she was not alone. Captain
Gerald Mauleverer, guided possibly by
some cousinly instinct, had also sought a
refuge from the music in the same spot. He
was sitting near her, and regarding her with
a reproachful countenance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know what my aunt has been
telling me about you?&#8221; he began.</p>

<p>Victoria gave a shrug of the most supreme
indifference.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; but I have no doubt it was something
interesting. My mother has so much
imagination.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>&#8220;She told me that you were as good as engaged.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did she? Ah, well, I suppose she has
found a purchaser for me at last.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can you!&#8221; Gerald stamped his foot.
&#8220;Who is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She did tell me his name, but I have forgotten
it,&#8221; drawled Victoria. &#8220;I can tell you
his income, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her cousin looked at her, half angry and
half pleased.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank Heaven, you don&#8217;t care for him!
I believe I have your heart, after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My what?&#8221; asked Victoria, in a tone of
surprised curiosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your heart, you hateful creature.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What childish words you use, Gerald!
I couldn&#8217;t understand what you meant. No;
I suppose I shall be bought complete, with
all fittings, but I don&#8217;t fancy a heart is mentioned
in the inventory.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you really promised to marry this
man, Vick?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>His cousin put her head on one side and
considered.</p>

<p>&#8220;It hasn&#8217;t got quite to that point. The
customer hasn&#8217;t actually given the order yet,
but my mother is an expert saleswoman, and
I have no doubt that by the next time you
see me I shall have the usual ticket on to
show that I am disposed of.&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain gnawed his mustache as his
eyes sought in vain to fix those of the insolent
beauty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hang it! don&#8217;t you care a little bit? I
have loved you for years. Does it all go for
nothing with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Victoria sat up and became business-like.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stupid fellow, why can&#8217;t you look at it
rationally, like I do? There, I will give in
to you so far as to say that I would much
rather you bought me than anybody else. I
would even give a discount in your case;
you should have me at store prices. But
what is the use? We couldn&#8217;t live together.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
You know they separate married couples in
the workhouse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have eight hundred a year,&#8221; the man
protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;That would pay for my frocks. Any
debts?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I have a little paper out,&#8221; he reluctantly
admitted.</p>

<p>&#8220;So I thought. Small income, large
debts&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not large debts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Several thousands, I have no doubt.
Large debts, no occupation&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you count the army?&#8221; he interrupted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not,&#8221; was the firm answer. &#8220;I
mean an occupation by which you can earn
a living. No occupation, idle habits, expensive
tastes&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Vick!&#8221; His tone became one of honest
indignation. &#8220;No, you can&#8217;t charge me
with that, you know. I may be idle, but you
can&#8217;t charge me with extravagance.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>&#8220;What do you pay for your cigars?&#8221; the
merciless inquisitor demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;A shilling. I get them at a little shop in
Jermyn Street that nobody else knows of,
and they are worth double the money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gerald!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, really, Vick, you have no right to
talk to me like that. If there&#8217;s one thing
that I do pride myself on, it is that I am economical.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the use of being economical on
nothing?&#8221; She turned and looked him full
in the face. &#8220;I will be serious with you,
Gerald. If you had any means at all, any
real income or prospect of it, I would throw
over all the millionaires in Christendom to-morrow,
but as it is&mdash;!&#8221; A despairing gesture
completed the sentence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t you wait for me, then?&#8221; exclaimed
the desperate captain. &#8220;Give me a
chance, and I will go out and raid the Transvaal,
or do something desperate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know there was anything very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
desperate in raiding the Transvaal,&#8221; retorted
Victoria, resuming her cynical vein. &#8220;I
thought the worst thing you exposed yourself
to was to have poetry written about you in
the papers.&#8221;</p>

<p>A door opened at the end of the gallery,
and Gerald hastily rose to his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! I felt sure we should be interrupted,&#8221;
said Victoria. &#8220;I believe my mother has me
shadowed. Don&#8217;t go, Gerald,&#8221; she added,
loudly enough for her parent to hear as she
bore down upon the pair, the faithful Despencer
following in the wake.</p>

<p>The marchioness came to a full stop at the
opening, with a dramatic start.</p>

<p>&#8220;Victoria! I thought I had forbidden you
to behave like this!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her daughter gave an amused smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear mother, I thought we agreed
only the other day that I was of age.&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness turned on her nephew as
a less dangerous adversary.</p>

<p>&#8220;As for you, Gerald, I am surprised at you.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
You ought to know better than to come and
sit here with your cousin.&#8221;</p>

<p>Victoria gallantly came to his rescue.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you and Mr. Despencer want to sit
here, we will go away,&#8221; she offered, sweetly.</p>

<p>The marchioness recoiled, and gazed at her
like King Lear listening to Goneril&#8217;s complaints
about his knights.</p>

<p>&#8220;When you are married I shall wash my
hands of you, and if your unfortunate husband
likes to let you carry on an open flirtation
with your cousin, he may,&#8221; she said, viciously.
&#8220;But while you are on my hands
I am determined to put a stop to these clandestine
doings. You hear me, Gerald?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerald felt that he must stand by his cousin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, aunt,&#8221; he said, with unlooked-for
courage; &#8220;but I don&#8217;t see how our flirtation
can be open and yet clandestine at the same
time. It must be one or the other, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the action was becoming general, the
marchioness with a look brought up her light
cavalry in the person of Despencer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that,&#8221; he interposed. &#8220;There
is no better concealment sometimes than a
parade of openness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, mamma, this won&#8217;t do!&#8221; Victoria
protested. &#8220;I have schooled myself to bear
Mr. Despencer&#8217;s compliments, but I really
don&#8217;t think I can stand him as a moralist. I
must draw the line somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness threw her broad shield
over her luckless ally.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Despencer was not speaking to you,
and I will not allow you to talk like that
when he is only acting in your true interests.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, I wish he wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; was the
rebellious answer. &#8220;One&#8217;s true interests are
always so singularly unpleasant. How
should you like it if Gerald or somebody
were to begin acting in your true interests?&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness looked alarmed.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, that will do,&#8221; she said, hurriedly.
&#8220;Understand me, Gerald, I particularly wish
to speak to Victoria for a minute by herself.
You won&#8217;t refuse a mother&#8217;s request?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>&#8220;Not when she is a woman,&#8221; returned the
reckless youth. And he strolled off.</p>

<p>The marchioness watched him safely
through the door of the gallery, and then
seated herself by her daughter&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank Heaven, we have got rid of him in
time!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, is anything particular going to
happen?&#8221; Victoria inquired, carelessly.</p>

<p>The marchioness glowed with triumph.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Hammond is coming here to propose
to you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that all?&#8221; said Victoria.</p>

<p>Despencer was becoming anxious to withdraw
before being favored with any more of
Lady Victoria&#8217;s sarcasms. The only way to
escape was to take her part against the marchioness.
He therefore remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;A most simple occurrence, which might
happen to anybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>His patroness turned to him indignantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Despencer, do you wish to encourage
her?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>&#8220;I fancy Lady Victoria requires no encouragement
from me. She appears to face
the situation with admirable nerve. Breeding
will tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go away, directly!&#8221; ordered the marchioness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; where to?&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness hesitated a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;To the end of the gallery.&#8221; Despencer
began to move away. &#8220;And wait there for
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I not always waiting for you, marchioness?&#8221;</p>

<p>And with a graceful bow to both ladies, he
retired to the opposite door to that by which
they had just entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you a little rough with the poor
creature?&#8221; asked Victoria, in a tone of compassion
as he disappeared. &#8220;You will break
him some day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you realize what I have just told you?&#8221;
said her mother, ignoring the remark.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have forgotten. Wasn&#8217;t it something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
about an offer of marriage? Who did you
say it was this time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will drive me distracted! Now, listen
to me; this may be your last chance. If
you refuse Mr. Hammond you may never get
another offer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is always Gerald to fall back upon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Another decent offer, I mean,&#8221; was the
stern retort. &#8220;Of course, you can always
marry. I dare say a dean or a county court
judge, or some one of that sort, would be willing
to take you with nothing but your clothes.
But this is the last respectable match I shall
offer you. I have taken the greatest pains
to bring this man to the point, and if you refuse
him now I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t try again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You frighten me, mother. I hope you
haven&#8217;t been resorting to extreme measures
against Mr. Hammond! You haven&#8217;t been
putting pressure on him by threatening to
reveal his past?&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness shook her head impatiently.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>&#8220;Answer me plainly, Victoria: do you intend
to accept him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure he is going to propose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Morally sure. He just asked me where
he was likely to find you, and I told him I
thought you would be here about this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you know that?&#8221; asked Victoria,
with interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I meant to look for you myself
and send you here,&#8221; was the resolute
answer. &#8220;In these matters I leave nothing
to chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You <i>have</i> taken pains!&#8221; exclaimed her
daughter, with genuine admiration. &#8220;But
you don&#8217;t know that he is going to propose.
He may only be going to say good-bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense! I know perfectly well. I can
always tell when a man is going to propose.
My judgment has never been deceived.&#8221;</p>

<p>Victoria affected to conceal a yawn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I am much obliged to you for warning
me. I shall be prepared.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you will accept him, won&#8217;t you, like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
a good girl?&#8221; pleaded the marchioness, with
maternal tenderness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t the slightest idea what I shall
do,&#8221; was the callous reply. &#8220;I hope he won&#8217;t
be sentimental over it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Victoria! Do you refuse to do your duty
to society and to your parents?&#8221;</p>

<p>Victoria was mildly annoyed.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, now <i>you</i> are going to be sentimental!&#8221;
she protested.</p>

<p>The marchioness rose to her feet in real
anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shameful, depraved, ungrateful child!
You wish to break your mother&#8217;s heart!&#8221;</p>

<p>Victoria darted a strange look at her
mother, which the marchioness was unable
to meet. Then she observed, quietly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think the less we say about
hearts the better, mamma?&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness was opening her lips to
reply, when her face suddenly changed, a
beautiful smile replacing the angry frown.
Hammond had just entered the gallery.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">SCENE XI<br />


<small>&#8220;AND WILL SHORTLY TAKE PLACE&#8221;</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is generally the first impulse of a man
who has been rejected by the woman he loves
to offer himself to the woman who loves him.
When the sun has set the light of the moon
becomes precious.</p>

<p>John Hammond did not believe that the
Lady Victoria Mauleverer did him the honor
to love him after the fashion in which he loved
Belle Yorke. But the frankness with which
she conducted their mutual flirtation made
him think of her as more sincere than the
over-innocent maidens who pretended to turn
shy at his approach, and practised the
blushes which they had been taught by a
Bond Street professor at a guinea a blush.
He felt that there was something flattering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
to him in her disdain of the small arts of cajolery,
and he told himself that the preference
which she so plainly showed for him
must needs be genuine.</p>

<p>It does not require very much to convince a
man of any self-confidence that he possesses
a woman&#8217;s regard. The very cynicism with
which Victoria discussed their relations
might be the cloak of a deeper feeling, which
she was too proud to confess until its return
was assured. In his present mood, however,
Hammond felt no desire to penetrate
beneath that surface good-comradeship,
which was all that either he or Victoria
had yet shown to the other. He could
not have gone from his interview with
Belle to make love to another woman. He,
no more than Victoria, desired to be sentimental.
Nevertheless, it soothed him to
think that this woman, who was willing
to meet him in his own spirit of indifference,
might be secretly more fond of him
than he was of her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>It seemed to him that the die was cast,
and that he could not too soon put it out of
his own power to recall the throw. He had
fought out the struggle between Love and
Ambition, and in the moment of surrendering
to Love, Love had failed him. Well,
Ambition was left. The marchioness had
correctly diagnosed the symptoms, though
she had little idea of their cause. John
Hammond had come to propose to Victoria.</p>

<p>It only remained for the forethoughtful
parent to get herself out of the way.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is too bad of you, Mr. Hammond!&#8221; she
exclaimed, with the playfulness of a boa-constrictor.
&#8220;I believe you knew I was here,
and waited down below on purpose for me to
go away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond smiled rather wearily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, that is very artful of you, marchioness.
The truth is that you are going away
just because I have come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are perfectly right, Mr. Hammond,&#8221;
remarked Victoria.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>Her mother wrenched her lips into the similitude
of a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see what it is,&#8221; she said, with immense
slyness. &#8220;You two have an understanding,
and you want to get rid of me. Very well,
I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t interfere with your little plans. I
always know when I am in the way. Good-bye.
Good-bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>The devoted parent nodded and smiled herself
out of the gallery, consumed with a frantic
inward longing to take her stubborn child
by the shoulders and shake her into a more
becoming frame of mind.</p>

<p>It was fortunate that she could not hear
that child&#8217;s first remark after she had gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;My poor mother amuses me very much.
She thinks she is such a deep schemer, and
she is so transparent all the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t ask me to take sides with an
undutiful daughter,&#8221; responded Hammond.
&#8220;May I sit down? I am lucky in finding
you here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t much luck about it,&#8221; said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
Victoria, bluntly, as she made way for him to
sit beside her. &#8220;My mother knew you were
coming, and ordered me to remain here to
meet you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The marchioness is very considerate,&#8221; replied
Hammond, fairly taken aback by this
extraordinary confidence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but I find it a little embarrassing
sometimes,&#8221; Victoria remarked. &#8220;She is so
very barefaced, you know. She positively
throws me at eligible men. I hope you don&#8217;t
mind having me thrown at you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contrary, I find it rather agreeable
than otherwise. You don&#8217;t hurt at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am so glad. Tell me when you are
tired, and I will make her leave off and throw
me at some one else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t there another alternative?&#8221; Hammond
saw a faint color come into Victoria&#8217;s
cheeks as he spoke, and went on quietly.
&#8220;Do you know, I wanted to see you, to consult
you about a letter that I received this
morning.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>He put his hand into his breast pocket and
drew out a blue envelope of the inconvenient
oblong shape still in use by so-called business
men. Victoria continued to recline in the same
lazy attitude on the divan, but she watched
him keenly out of the corner of her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;How interesting!&#8221; she murmured, as he
drew out a closely written sheet and unfolded
it. &#8220;I hope it is an anonymous letter taking
away my character.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; curiously enough, it is from one who
has a very high opinion of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Victoria became more languid still.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am dying to hear it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall.&#8221; He began to read aloud:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verseright">&#8220;&#8216;<span class="smcap">Boot and Shoe Emporium,</span></div>
<div class="verseright">&#8220;<span class="smcap">High Street, Tooting.</span>&#8217;&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;I know who it is from!&#8221; Victoria exclaimed,
eagerly. &#8220;That delightful alderman!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t interrupt, please. &#8216;<i>My dear Mr.
Hammond&mdash;</i>&#8217;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>&#8220;How sweetly friendly!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush! &#8216;<i>It is with considerable reluctance
that I have consented, at the request of
many of your leading supporters in the Division,
to address you on a subject of great
delicacy and importance&mdash;</i>&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mysterious creature!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;<i>I refer to the question of your marriage&mdash;</i>&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is most interesting!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond frowned sternly at the fair interrupter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait! &#8216;<i>Some time ago it was generally
rumored in the constituency that you were
likely to lead to the altar Lady Victoria Hildegonde
Jane Beauchamp-Mauleverer</i>, only
<i>daughter of the most noble the Marquis of Severn,
K.G.&mdash;</i>&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He must have looked me up in Whitaker&#8217;s
&#8216;Titled Persons.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;<i>And the news gave us the greatest satisfaction,
as it was felt that by so doing you
would greatly strengthen your social prestige,
and thereby deprive the Liberals of their advantage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
in having secured a baronet as their
candidate&mdash;</i>&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He quite crushes you there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;<i>But I regret to state that a report has now
reached us that this marriage is not likely to
come off, and your enemies have the audacity
to allege that you are contemplating a union
with a singer on the music-hall stage whose
name has been a target for the breath of scandal.
Your friends have, of course, indignantly
denied the rumor, but we think it would be
desirable in your interest that you should at
once write me a formal contradiction, which
could be inserted, if necessary, in the local press.
Trusting you will see your way to do this, and
apologizing for the liberty I have taken, with
very kind regards, I am, yours sincerely</i>,</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;&#8216;<span class="smcap">Edward Dobbin</span>.&#8217;&#8221;</p>


<p>&#8220;He gets rather prosy towards the end,
doesn&#8217;t he?&#8221; commented Victoria, who had
listened in silence to that part of the letter.</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t heard the postscript,&#8221; said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
Hammond. &#8220;&#8216;P.S.&mdash;<i>If you could at the
same time authorize me to announce your engagement
to Lady Beauchamp-Mauleverer,
we consider it would have an excellent effect.</i>&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Artful old thing! He is almost as bad
as my mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond folded up the letter and put it
back in his pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now, what do you advise me to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, send the contradiction, by all means.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what about the further announcement?&#8221;</p>

<p>Their eyes met seriously for the first time.
Victoria answered, in the same light tone:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it seems a pity to disappoint
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you won&#8217;t contradict it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I never write to the papers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond bent forward respectfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you. May I kiss your hand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will promise not to be sentimental,&#8221;
said Victoria, yielding gracefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I can promise that,&#8221; said Hammond,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
with secret bitterness. And he bowed
over the white fingers, wondering if this
woman really wished to be his wife, while
Victoria wondered in her turn why on earth
this man wanted to marry her.</p>

<p>They were not left long in their mutual
embarrassment. The marchioness was burning
with impatience to learn the result of her
arduous campaign, and as soon as she
thought she had given the lovers time enough
to adjust matters she returned to the spot,
Despencer being admitted to share the anticipated
triumph.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you are still here!&#8221; the mother exclaimed,
with innocent surprise. &#8220;I hope
that girl has not been shocking you very
much, Mr. Hammond?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, she has, rather,&#8221; he answered, dryly.
&#8220;She has promised to be my wife!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear child!&#8221; The loving mother
rushed to fold her daughter in a close embrace,
to which Victoria submitted with silent
scorn. &#8220;This is sudden, but I cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
say it takes me altogether by surprise. A
mother&#8217;s eye sees so much,&#8221; added the marchioness,
plaintively, implying that she had
long watched over her child&#8217;s secret love
and seen it grow from day to day.</p>

<p>Despencer stood viewing the touching
scene with an ironical smile. &#8220;She will
overdo this if she isn&#8217;t careful,&#8221; was his unspoken
comment.</p>

<p>The marchioness turned to her new
son.</p>

<p>&#8220;I give her to you, John, because I know
you will make her happy. If I had had the
choice of a son-in-law, there is no one I should
have preferred to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>As a bald matter of fact, there had been a
slight element of choice about it.</p>

<p>Hammond bowed with due gratitude.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me offer my congratulations, too, if
I may,&#8221; Despencer put in. &#8220;This sort of
thing quite touches me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Hammond, curtly. &#8220;I
hope to have the pleasure of speaking to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
marquis in the morning,&#8221; he added to the
marquis&#8217;s wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will prepare him for it. I am sure you
will find him ready to welcome you as a son,&#8221;
responded the marchioness, with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Victoria rose from her seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, that will do, mother. You are not
good at domestic sentiment; it isn&#8217;t in your
line. Can&#8217;t we go and bill and coo somewhere
else?&#8221; she said to her betrothed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a child!&#8221; murmured her parent,
still deeply affected. &#8220;Take care of her,
John.&#8221;</p>

<p>John intimated his disposition to do so by
a bow, and the marchioness and Despencer
found themselves alone. The latter hastened
to console his companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mind her, marchioness. You did
that very well, indeed. The maternal embrace
was perfect.&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness sat down on the divan
and heaved a deep sigh of satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may be as rude as you like now,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
she observed, mildly, &#8220;because you have been
so clever and wicked in managing this for
me. I suppose it is quite settled now. He
won&#8217;t go back to that horrid girl again?&#8221;</p>

<p>Despencer placed himself on the seat beside
the marchioness at the exact distance
which he thought safe, as he replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;I think not. The game is not quite finished
yet. I am still waiting to play my ace
of trumps.&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness was too full of her triumph
to heed the last words.</p>

<p>&#8220;We had better announce this in the papers
at once,&#8221; she remarked, pursuing her
own line of thought. &#8220;One cannot make too
sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will have to wait till he has seen
Lord Severn,&#8221; suggested the prudent Despencer.</p>

<p>The marchioness made a grimace.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose so. How tiresome all this etiquette
is! I sometimes wish I could go and
be a curate&#8217;s wife in the country.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>This pathetic yearning failed to move the
callous listener. He retorted:</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe there is no more rigid code of
etiquette than that which obtains among
curates&#8217; wives in the country. I used to
know three curates&#8217; wives and one rector&#8217;s,
but they have all dropped me. I never knew
why.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid you must have a dreadful
reputation,&#8221; said the marchioness, admiringly.
&#8220;I positively don&#8217;t think I ought to stay
here alone with you. Do you know they call
this the Lovers&#8217; Window?&#8221;</p>

<p>Despencer&#8217;s eyes fell on the marchioness,
and he ventured two and a half inches nearer.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a romantic situation! You ought
not to have told me that. Remember that I
am a poet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid you are only mocking me,&#8221;
said the marchioness, lowering her eyes with
a bashfulness which, regarded as a work of
art, was beautiful. &#8220;I believe you are a
heartless cynic.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>Despencer moved an inch nearer along the
divan as he protested&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you are quite wrong. You must not
judge me by outward appearances, or you
will be deceived. The fact is, I am a hypocrite.
I pretend to be more worldly and
wicked than I really am. If you could look
into my heart you would be surprised.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no doubt of that. But you are
not going to persuade me that I should find
much innocence there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! but, my dear marchioness, why speak
of it like that? Think how uninteresting
innocence is. Believe me, innocence has been
sadly overpraised by people who knew very
little about it. For my part, I much prefer
experience. One is a blank page, the other is
a romance, generally of the kind that is not
allowed on the railway book-stalls.&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness was not insensible to the
subtle flattery. Her voice became actually
soft.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not going to pretend to me that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
there is anything romantic about an old
woman who will soon be forty.&#8221; (The
marchioness&#8217;s own age in society was thirty-seven.)</p>

<p>Despencer moved six inches closer. But
there was no softening in his voice; that
was where he had the advantage over the
marchioness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Every woman is romantic when she is
seated in the Lovers&#8217; Window with a man,&#8221;
he murmured in her ear.</p>

<p>What might have happened next it is impossible
even to imagine. What did happen
was that both started violently apart, and
rose to their feet at the same time, the marchioness
exclaiming, in a tone of subdued
consternation, &#8220;Of all men in the world, my
husband!&#8221;</p>

<p>The Marquis of Severn had come in very
quietly by the door at the farther end of the
gallery. As his wife and her companion
came rather awkwardly out on to the floor of
the gallery, he walked past them into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
window, scarcely heeding their presence, and
stood with his back towards them, looking
out at the slowly rising moon.</p>

<p>Throwing an impatient frown behind her,
the marchioness led the way out by the other
door. Just as they reached it it was opened
from without, revealing on the threshold
Belle Yorke.</p>

<p>The marchioness stopped abruptly, and
directed an astonished and inquisitive glance
from Belle to her husband, and from her
husband to Belle. Then she took hold of
Despencer&#8217;s arm and marched off in formidable
silence.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">SCENE XII<br />


<small>THE LONG ARM OF MR. DESPENCER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">George, Marquis of Severn</span>, was one
of those unfortunate men who are out of sympathy
with the class into which they have
been born. As a yeoman, farming his own
land, he would have been contented; as a
marquis, he was miserable. His rank was
irksome to him, he was bored by dignity, he
took no interest in politics, and detested what
is called society.</p>

<p>If his lot had lain in a humbler sphere of
life, he would have had a wife of his own
choice, and been a good husband and father.
As it was, he had married a woman
selected for him by his people, and with
whom he had not a thought in common.
She was not his wife&mdash;she was merely his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
marchioness. He felt himself a stranger
in his own household; his very children
grew up to regard him with good-natured
contempt, and the people with whom Lady
Severn surrounded herself were hardly conscious
that there was such a person as
Lord Severn in existence.</p>

<p>By natural disposition George Mauleverer
was the reverse of a libertine. He was fitted
for domestic happiness as it is understood
by the middle classes. The irony of his fate
compelled him to seek it away from his own
hearth, under conditions fatal to its permanence.
The woman whom he had taken as
his second wife, and whom he would willingly
have continued to treat as such, was too
much like himself to rest satisfied in a life
which outraged the social and moral prejudices
of her class. She could not find satisfaction
any more than he in that restless,
artificial form of existence which is known
as a life of pleasure. She hated the gay sisterhood
of St. John, and yearned after the respectability<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
in which she had been reared.
To these motives for breaking off the connection
was added, after a few years, the
decisive one of religion. A sermon convicted
her of living in sin, and she resolved
to return to the paths of righteousness.</p>

<p>George Mauleverer could not oppose her
determination. He sorrowfully recognized
that she was in the right, and assisted her
efforts to regain her natural place in the
world. In due course she found a husband,
and from that moment all intercourse between
the two came to an end.</p>

<p>The only right which the man reserved to
himself was that of watching over the child
of their former union. He had done this
under an assumed name, and in the character
of a godfather. Neither he nor the mother
had contemplated the necessity of revealing
the truth to their daughter. But they had
reckoned without the world. Just as Belle
was growing into womanhood her stepfather
died, and her mother was threatened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
with disastrous poverty. In that strait she
would not consent to take money from her
old lover. As a lesser evil, she allowed
her daughter to turn her talents to account
on the stage.</p>

<p>It had occurred neither to her nor to Belle&#8217;s
father that the secret which had been kept so
successfully while Belle remained in the obscurity
of middle-class life might be endangered
by the publicity which she must now
incur. The father continued to associate with
his daughter under the name by which she
knew him. But Belle&#8217;s comings and goings
now fell under the eyes of more than one who
knew the Marquis of Severn. London is not
such a large place as some of us are apt to
suppose; or, rather, within the small area
covered by a dozen theatres and restaurants
which some of us are apt to mistake for London,
there is not much more real privacy than
in a village for those whose doings happen
to be of interest to the lookers-on.</p>

<p>It did not take long for the world of Piccadilly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
Circus to discover the identity of the
quiet, badly dressed, middle-aged man who
was seen from time to time in the company
of the celebrated Belle Yorke. Further
than that the world could hardly be expected
to inquire. It drew its own conclusions,
and very naturally judged others by
itself.</p>

<p>No whisper of the discovery had yet reached
the ears of the Marquis of Severn. When
he heard his daughter&#8217;s name announced in
his wife&#8217;s drawing-room, he had realized for
the first time the danger and falsity of his
position. At once he made up his mind that
it was necessary for Belle to know the truth.
The merest accident, the sight of one of his
portraits, might lead to a scandal. He dared
not run the risk of going up to her himself before
the crowd. He escaped into another
room, and, finding his nephew there, resolved
to intrust him with the task of speaking to
Belle.</p>

<p>Gerald had always had a loyal regard for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
his homely and despised uncle. He listened
to his confession with sympathy, and undertook
to warn Belle that she was in her father&#8217;s
house. But he had carried out his task imperfectly.
The marquis realized that he must
himself complete the revelation which Gerald
had begun. He had found Belle for a moment by herself,
and had arranged this meeting
in a spot where he expected to be free
from interruption.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should the marchioness look at you
like that?&#8221; asked Belle, in perfect innocence,
as she came towards the window, where her
father was waiting for her.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is one of the things that I have to
tell you,&#8221; he answered, gravely. &#8220;But sit
down, my dear, sit down.&#8221;</p>

<p>She obeyed, and gazed up at him wonderingly
as he stood before her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought it better to bring you here,&#8221;
he explained. &#8220;We might have been disturbed
down-stairs, but no one ever comes
here except the members of the family.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>Belle opened her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you, then&mdash;what about you? Are
you a member of the same family as the
Marchioness of Severn?&#8221;</p>

<p>The marquis bowed his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I am a member of the family. That
is what I want to speak to you about. I
want to tell you a family secret.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why? Why should you tell me?&#8221;
she gasped, with something like dismay. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t belong to the Marquis of Severn&#8217;s
family.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her father stifled a groan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose I were to tell you that you did?&#8221;
he said in a low voice.</p>

<p>The recollection of her interview with Captain
Mauleverer rushed over Belle. She
shrank back and raised her hands as though
for protection.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; this&mdash;this isn&#8217;t the secret, is it?&#8221; she
whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;I have just
spoken to Gerald, and he tells me that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
only delivered half of the message he was
to have given you this evening. Do you
think you can bear to hear the rest?&#8221;</p>

<p>Again she held up her hands with that
pathetic, deprecating gesture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait! Don&#8217;t tell it to me too quickly!
Give me time to think a little, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor child!&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned away his head, unable to face
the sight of her distress, and silence reigned
for a minute. Belle was the first to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Mauleverer told me that my
father was still alive. That is true, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that is true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that&mdash;that&mdash; Oh, tell it me as kindly
as you can!&#8221;</p>

<p>The marquis caught his breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your father is a damned villain!&#8221; he
cried out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t speak so harshly as that!&#8221; she implored.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t make him out worse than
you can help. Remember, I am his daughter,
after all.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>&#8220;You are too good for him, Belle. He
doesn&#8217;t deserve that you should call yourself
his daughter.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked up quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know him, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then&mdash;is he a relation of Lord Severn&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is Lord Severn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; In the midst of her astonishment
a bitter thought came into her mind. &#8220;Now
I begin to understand. So that is why Lord
Severn left the house the moment I arrived,
without seeing me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that is the reason.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why was I asked to come here, then?
Why did he let his wife bring me here to sing
for hire in my own father&#8217;s house? Oh, it
was cruel, cruel!&#8221;</p>

<p>The marquis shook beneath the reproach.</p>

<p>&#8220;He did not know; the marchioness arranged
it without telling him. Your father
knew nothing of it till you were here.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>&#8220;And the marchioness?&#8221; she demanded,
with sudden fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;The marchioness has never heard that
you are his daughter. It has been kept a
secret from every one.&#8221;</p>

<p>The expression of Belle&#8217;s face became hard.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see. Lord Severn is a great nobleman,
I suppose, and he was ashamed of the poor
little music-hall singer whom he had cast off
as soon as she was born, and whom he never
wished to see. So that is why he ordered
his nephew to speak to me, to warn me off
the premises, lest I should embarrass him
before his noble wife and daughter. And
now he has sent you to complete the work.&#8221;
She rose to her feet in bitter indignation.
&#8220;Well, you may tell my father that he has
no need to fear. I will not trouble him; I
will go.&#8221;</p>

<p>Every word stung the marquis like the
knot of a lash.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; he cried, passionately. &#8220;What are
you thinking of? You cannot go like this.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>&#8220;And do you think,&#8221; said Belle, turning on
him with flashing eyes, &#8220;that now I know
the truth I will stop another moment beneath
the roof of a father who considers
me a disgrace to him? I will go, if I
should have to walk the whole way home
barefoot!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, stay; you don&#8217;t understand! My
God, that you should take it like this! Your
father is not ashamed of you, but of himself.
It is he who disgraces you, not you him. He
went away because he had not the courage
to meet you, and to tell you with his own lips
the injury he had done you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that the truth?&#8221; She gazed at him in
doubt, a half-formed suspicion beginning to
struggle faintly for entrance to her mind.
&#8220;Then why has he never come near me since
I was born? Why has he let me grow up
in ignorance that I had a father? Why has
he never cast one glance of pity towards his
nameless child?&#8221;</p>

<p>The marquis stood silent, eager to answer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
and yet afraid. She went on with increasing
vehemence:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I am not his child; the Lady Victoria
is his child. She has sat upon his
knee; I never have. She bears his name,
and is protected by his rank; I bear a name
to which I have no right, and have no one to
protect me. She has been reared in her
father&#8217;s house, among riches and splendor;
I have grown up in obscurity, and have had
to go out to battle with the world. She
meets in her father&#8217;s drawing-room the
men whom I meet in the street. No;
you are wrong in telling me that Lord
Severn is my father. I have no father.
Lady Victoria is his daughter, but I am
only his orphan.&#8221;</p>

<p>The marquis broke down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Belle, don&#8217;t make it too hard for me,&#8221; he
said, humbly. &#8220;Your father has not been
quite so bad as that. He has watched over
you, but, like a coward, in disguise.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a minute she stood with heaving breast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
gazing at him, while his own eyes were cast
down before her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father! You!&#8221; The words escaped slowly
from her lips at last.</p>

<p>Her father gave a bitter sigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we men could foresee these moments
in our lives, we should not sin so lightly.
Yes, I have done you the greatest injury
that a father can do his child. I have tried
all these years to persuade myself that the
best atonement I could make was to keep you
in ignorance of the truth; but now the truth
has been forced from me, and you see me
ashamed to look you in the face.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t speak like that!&#8221; said his daughter,
gently; &#8220;don&#8217;t look away from me! Why,
I thought I had no father, but now&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked up swiftly, a new hope in his
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are going to forgive me, my child?&#8221;
he said, and trembled.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Belle, simply, &#8220;I am going to
love you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>He uttered a cry, and clasped her to
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;After all,&#8221; she said presently with a tearful
smile, &#8220;I was only a poor little music-hall
singer before. It isn&#8217;t as if I had much character
to lose, is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very good to me, my child. If
you knew how often I have wanted to tell
you who I was, and been afraid to do it!
The Fates prepare some rough places for
us, but the beds we make for ourselves are
the hardest to lie on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does any one else know of this, father?&#8221;
Belle asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No one knows it except Gerald, and I
can trust him. This must be a secret between
us two, Belle. It is the one favor I
have to ask of you; and I don&#8217;t ask it for my
own sake, but for the sake of my family.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For the sake of the Marchioness of Severn.
I understand.&#8221; There was a touch of
resentment in her voice. &#8220;She has been
good enough to speak to me since I came to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
this house; she has explained to me the gulf
that separates her world from mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My child! If you knew how bitter it is
to me not to be able to spare you such things!
But what motive could she have had for
speaking to you like that? She can have no
suspicion of the truth, surely?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no. She simply wished to point out
to me how unworthy I was to receive the
honorable addresses of a gentleman such as
her daughter might accept.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What man is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. John Hammond.&#8221;</p>

<p>The marquis started. It was the first time
he had heard Hammond&#8217;s name in connection
with Belle&#8217;s, and he was not ignorant of
his wife&#8217;s designs on behalf of Victoria.</p>

<p>&#8220;The very man!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;And
you&mdash;what have you done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have taken her ladyship&#8217;s good advice,&#8221;
said Belle, proudly. &#8220;I have refused Mr.
Hammond.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her father stood and gazed at her in consternation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
This rivalry between his two
daughters, the rich one and the poor one,
came on him as an unexpected shock. Suddenly
there came a sound of the door opening
at the end of the gallery.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must not be seen!&#8221; burst from his
lips; and, without pausing to consider the
possible consequences, he seized hold of the
curtains and drew them across the opening.</p>

<p>There had been two persons outside the
door, and they entered together. One was
Despencer, the other was John Hammond.</p>

<p>It was not in Despencer&#8217;s nature to be
revengeful, but he had not been left entirely
unmoved by Hammond&#8217;s biting taunts during
their interview in the conservatory. But
for them he might have been satisfied with
the success already achieved. His only motive
in denouncing Belle Yorke in the first
place had been to bring about the engagement
which he had just seen ratified. It
was Hammond&#8217;s insulting treatment of him
which had given him a personal interest in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
the affair. He yielded to the temptation of
proving himself right and scoring off the
man who had disbelieved him. As soon as
he could manage his escape from the marchioness,
he went to seek Hammond and
bring him to the spot where he had left the
marquis and Belle Yorke together.</p>

<p>Hammond at first refused to listen. Belle
had assured him with her own lips that she
had never even seen the man with whom her
name was coupled. But Despencer&#8217;s statement
compelled him to action. Wondering,
reluctant, and dismayed, he allowed himself
to be dragged into the gallery.</p>

<p>Both men as they entered glanced eagerly
in the direction of the window. The next
instant both stopped abruptly, and their
eyes met. Despencer&#8217;s filled with malicious
triumph, Hammond&#8217;s with the deepest mortification.</p>

<p>The curtains were closed. Who was behind
them?</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, if you wish to know the truth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
draw that curtain,&#8221; the tempter whispered.
Then he walked slowly out of the gallery,
watching Hammond as he went.</p>

<p>Left to himself, Hammond stood in silent
anguish, his gaze fixed on the velvet folds
which spared him the sight of the falsehood
of the woman he loved. Fresh from his
betrothal to Victoria, he had forgotten her
already, so much greater was the bitterness
of finding that his love was misplaced than
the bitterness of having it rejected. He
thought he could hear that Belle should not
love him, but he found he could not bear that
she should love another.</p>

<p>Face to face with that curtain, there
seemed to be no more room for doubt. Despencer
might not be a man of honor, but
he could not, he dared not, have brought
Hammond there unless he were sure of the
result. What inducement had Despencer to
lie? None. And Belle? Alas! it was evident
that she had only too much.</p>

<p>He took a step towards the curtain, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
then drew back. What right had he to lift
it? What right had he, the promised husband
of Lady Victoria, to test the faith of
the woman who had just refused his hand?
Reason bade him go away, satisfied with
the silent testimony of that damning screen.</p>

<p>But reason is a mere lawyer, whose client
is passion. John Hammond could no more
leave that gallery without drawing the curtain
than the steel can detach itself from the
magnet. It did not take long to reason himself
into the belief that to go away now would
be disloyalty to Belle herself; it would be to
accept Despencer&#8217;s word against hers without
inquiry. He stepped forward again, and his
hand was stretched out towards the curtain,
when he was arrested by the entrance of a
man at the opposite door.</p>

<p>Captain Mauleverer had taken advantage
of his dismissal by the marchioness to wander
off to a nook at the top of his uncle&#8217;s
house and indulge in a quiet smoke. Returning
through the gallery, where he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
half hoped to find Victoria waiting for him,
he was surprised to find himself in the presence
of Hammond.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Hammond, what are you doing
here all by yourself?&#8221; he exclaimed as he
came up.</p>

<p>Hammond drew back a few steps from the
curtain.</p>

<p>&#8220;What am I doing?&#8221; He raised his voice
and glanced towards the purple folds as
though he would have looked through them
to see the effect of his words. &#8220;I am wondering
why it is that we men are ever fools
enough to expect truth from the lips of a
woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that all?&#8221; returned Mauleverer, his
own mood in harmony with his friend&#8217;s. &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t know that any sensible man ever did.
I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what is wrong with you?&#8221; asked
the other, incredulously. &#8220;You haven&#8217;t been
deceived by the woman you trusted?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me we all have,&#8221; was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
bitter answer. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you remember what
I was telling you about down-stairs?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes; I had forgotten it. You mean
that girl? Why, have you just discovered
that she really loves another man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not that exactly. She loves me, or she
pretends to, but she has sold herself to the
other man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She doesn&#8217;t love you!&#8221; The words were
pronounced with an emphasis which Mauleverer
could not understand, and which was
not meant for his ears. &#8220;They all pretend,
if not in words, in looks and actions. It is
their occupation, like politics with us. I
knew a woman once who made me think
she loved me. She never said so, you understand,
but led me on, and laughed at me
in her sleeve all the while. Depend upon
it, this girl of yours is like her. She has
some secret lover in the background, some
man whom she has sworn to you that she
has never seen.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were three listeners to that savage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
outburst&mdash;two men and a woman; but only
the woman understood.</p>

<p>The captain remonstrated.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that of her. No; hang it!
the girl is straight enough. She doesn&#8217;t
think me worth deceiving; I am too poor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see. Then it is the other man she is
deceiving, and you are the lover in the background.
You see, it comes to the same thing.
I told you they were all alike.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not her fault, damn it!&#8221; said the
loyal Gerald. &#8220;She has got to marry the
brute; her people have driven her into it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t ask. Money. It&#8217;s some infernal
millionaire like you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond started. For the first time he
turned his attention from the unseen listeners
to this dialogue to the man who was speaking
to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who? What did you say? Who is this
man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know his name; she wouldn&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
tell me,&#8221; replied the suspicious captain.
&#8220;What does it matter to me who he is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I know the girl?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I don&#8217;t mind telling you, old man;
it&#8217;s my cousin Victoria.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; The word burst from Hammond
like a bullet. His eyes sought the curtain.
&#8220;Are all women traitors?&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>And striding to the curtains, he dragged
them back. There in the light of the moon
stood the two who had overheard every word.
The marquis had his arm round Belle&#8217;s neck,
and her face was hidden in her father&#8217;s breast.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is true!&#8221; gasped Hammond.</p>

<p>A tremendous silence followed. How long
it lasted none of the four could tell. At
length the marquis broke it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, sir?&#8221; he said, looking Hammond
full in the face with a certain dignity for
which the other had not been prepared.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon, marquis. I was told
that you and this lady were strangers, and I
believed it, like a fool.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>He had turned on his heel to withdraw,
when he was made aware that some one else
was coming on the scene. He glanced
towards the door, and then with a bow of
silent apology drew the curtains across again
as he had found them. This done, he turned
round and stood facing whoever might
come in.</p>

<p>He had expected Despencer, and he was
right. But Despencer had not come alone.
He had had another object in view all this
time, and what that object was was now revealed.
Having arranged for what promised
to be a stormy scene between Hammond
and the Marquis of Severn, having
fired his train and calculated the time required
for it to reach the mine, he had now
brought the marchioness to witness the
explosion.</p>

<p>The marchioness entered quickly, her face
alight with suspicion. Despencer had skilfully
aroused her expectations, without committing
himself to any definite statement.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
Her eye instantly fell on the curtain, and she
divined that it concealed a mystery.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why is that curtain closed?&#8221; she demanded,
advancing towards it. &#8220;Is there
any one in the window?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was just one instant in which Hammond
hesitated, nearly carried away by the
temptation to let her draw back the curtain
and overwhelm those two by whom he deemed
that he had been deceived. Then, just as the
horrified Gerald was about to step forward,
Hammond planted himself right in front of
the marchioness.</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; he said, firmly. &#8220;There is no one
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stopped unwillingly and looked at
him. He looked at her, and to that look
she yielded.</p>

<p>A moment afterwards he was leading her
out of the gallery on his arm, while Captain
Mauleverer escorted Despencer in the rear.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">SCENE XIII<br />


<small>THE MARCHIONESS AT BAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Has</span> anything happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The worst has happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the morning after the concert, and
the sedulous Despencer had called upon his
exacting patroness, as in duty bound. The
marchioness had only just descended; she
had made a hurried toilette, and in consequence
the pearl powder was not quite so
delicately shaded off round her neck as usual,
and her waist was at least half an inch wider
than its wont.</p>

<p>Such touching traces of maternal anxiety
were not lost on the observant Despencer.
There is no eye like that of love.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what is it? You alarm me,&#8221; he
said, lazily sinking into a chair in front of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
marchioness. They were in her boudoir, an
apartment which ladies reserve for the reception
of gentlemen who do not happen to be
married to them. The Marquis of Severn
had not been in his wife&#8217;s boudoir for ten
years.</p>

<p>&#8220;That man Hammond has had the audacity
to send a note to Victoria this
morning asking her to release him from
their engagement,&#8221; the marchioness announced.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why on earth has he done that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He says he finds he has mistaken the
nature of his feelings for her,&#8221; said the marchioness,
with fine scorn.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a ridiculous idea! As if his feelings
had anything to do with it! The man
must be a scoundrel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is worse,&#8221; said the marchioness with
conviction; &#8220;he is a fool. Oh, if I had only
sent the announcement to the papers last
night; then they could neither of them have
backed out of it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>&#8220;What does Lady Victoria say?&#8221; inquired
her friend, cautiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;She pretends to be perfectly indifferent.
She treats the affair as if it were more my
concern than hers. That is what is so hard.
If she only took a proper interest in her own
position, I should not be afraid; but when I
have to deal with a man who says he doesn&#8217;t
want to marry my daughter, and a daughter
who says she doesn&#8217;t want to marry him,
what am I, as a mother, to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>She gazed plaintively at Despencer, who
considerately shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a difficult position, certainly, but I
don&#8217;t despair,&#8221; he remarked, encouragingly.
&#8220;I have the very greatest confidence in you,
marchioness. I shall be quite interested to
see how you get on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be so heartless and unfeeling! I
consider this is as much your business as
mine. You helped to bring about the engagement,
and now you ought to support
me in holding this man to his word.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>&#8220;Well, if you are going to bring an action,
I shall be delighted to give evidence, but I
don&#8217;t see what else I can do.&#8221; He paused a
moment, and then asked, in a different tone:
&#8220;Have you any idea of the cause of this
sudden change? I thought everything was
going so smoothly last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness gave an emphatic nod.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is just what I want to know. I suspect
that it has something to do with that
scene in the picture-gallery, and I am determined
to get at the truth about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really!&#8221; Despencer regarded her with
an amused smile. &#8220;Do you know, I quite
envy you. You are so energetic, and so
hopeful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean by that, I suppose, that you
don&#8217;t think I shall succeed?&#8221;</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders with bland deprecation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I can only say that in the course
of my experience I have several times tried
to get at the truth where a man and a woman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
were concerned, and <i>I</i> never succeeded. You
may be more fortunate.&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness darted a suspicious look
at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;One thing I mean to know anyway, and
that is, who were behind that curtain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Despencer stole a glance at her sideways.</p>

<p>&#8220;There I think you are unwise. It is always
so much better <i>not</i> to know who are
behind the curtain.&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness sat up and frowned in
earnest.</p>

<p>&#8220;That shows that you think it was my
husband and Belle Yorke. Mr. Despencer,
I can see that there is some connection between
those two, and that you know all
about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Despencer smiled pleasantly, with the satisfaction
of a general who sees the enemy
march straight into the ambush he has prepared.
He could even afford to play with
his victim.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my dear marchioness, what do you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
take me for?&#8221; he returned, with an insincerity
not intended to deceive. &#8220;Am I a
necromancer? Am I the author of &#8216;Who&#8217;s
Who&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>But, much to his inward disappointment,
he was saved from further questioning by
the entrance at this juncture of the marchioness&#8217;s
nephew, to whom she had sent an
urgent summons before Despencer&#8217;s arrival.</p>

<p>Captain Mauleverer came in looking very
guilty and ashamed, though he made a
poor bravado of ignorance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, aunt, what is it?&#8221; he inquired,
scarcely troubling to acknowledge Despencer&#8217;s
presence by a nod.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down, please,&#8221; ordered the marchioness.
&#8220;I want you to tell me exactly what
passed in the picture-gallery last night before
I came in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerald sat down with ill-concealed reluctance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid there is nothing I can tell
you,&#8221; he stammered.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>&#8220;Oh, yes, there is,&#8221; his aunt retorted.
&#8220;What were you and Mr. Hammond doing
there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not aware that we were doing anything,&#8221;
was the sullen answer. &#8220;We met
there by accident, and we fell into conversation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was the conversation about?&#8221; pursued
the relentless examiner.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I can&#8217;t even tell you
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know that Mr. Hammond is engaged
to your cousin Victoria?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I gathered something of the kind from
what he said.&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness pounced on the admission.</p>

<p>&#8220;So much the better. You hear that,
Mr. Despencer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly. Most damaging evidence. He
can&#8217;t possibly get out of that,&#8221; murmured the
faithful one.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear aunt!&#8221; exclaimed the startled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
captain, &#8220;surely you don&#8217;t anticipate any
trouble with Hammond, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind. You say that he has made
the engagement a subject of conversation
among his friends, and that is sufficient to
bind him as an honorable man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, good heavens! I didn&#8217;t say that,&#8221;
protested her unfortunate nephew.</p>

<p>The marchioness turned coldly to her
ally.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Despencer, you heard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Most distinctly,&#8221; said the witness. &#8220;Nothing
could be clearer.&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain became desperate. He tried
to explain:</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;but really, it was from Victoria that
I heard of it first, only she didn&#8217;t mention
Hammond&#8217;s name.&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness smiled cruelly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good. Then I shall be able to tell
him that she has also announced the engagement
among <i>her</i> friends.&#8221; She turned
to Despencer. &#8220;What do you say to that?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>&#8220;It is absolutely conclusive. It doesn&#8217;t
leave him a single loop-hole.&#8221;</p>

<p>The miserable captain writhed helplessly,
like a victim in the hands of the Holy Office,
finding every answer twisted into a fresh
heresy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, do you mean to say that there
is a chance of his breaking it off?&#8221; he asked
the marchioness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not the very slightest,&#8221; was the grim response;
&#8220;but he may try to.&#8221; All at once
her manner became coaxing. &#8220;Now, I trust
to you, Gerald, as a gentleman, not to stand
in your cousin&#8217;s way. You can&#8217;t marry her
yourself, as you know perfectly well, and
therefore you ought not to prevent her making
a good match.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not likely to,&#8221; he answered, gloomily.
&#8220;As long as Vick and Hammond are
engaged, I am out of it altogether.&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness looked extremely relieved.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is right,&#8221; she said, approvingly. &#8220;I
knew I could rely on your good feelings not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
to let two millions go out of the family. But
now, are you quite sure, Gerald, that you
said nothing to Mr. Hammond last night that
might have led him to suspect that there was
something between you and Victoria?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerald, conscious of having assured Hammond
with considerable earnestness that
Victoria loved himself, turned red as he
stammered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;er&mdash;well&mdash;I don&#8217;t know; the fact is,
you see, I didn&#8217;t understand&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>His aunt came to his relief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly. I thought as much. Now,
Gerald, I shall be seeing Mr. Hammond
this morning, and I leave it to your sense
of honor to go and speak to him and put
things right first. You understand me?&#8221;</p>

<p>The wretched Mauleverer rose to go out.
On his way to the door he caught Despencer&#8217;s
mocking smile, and longed to kick him. As
soon as he was gone, the other, unconscious
of the peril he had run, uttered the words:</p>

<p>&#8220;Marchioness, you are a great woman!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">SCENE XIV<br />


<small>PISTOLS FOR TWO</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">John Hammond</span>, although a bachelor,
lived in a very good house, in the same
neighborhood as Lord Severn&#8217;s, and, strange
as it may appear to the author of <i>The Christian</i>,
he possessed more than one teaspoon.
When he had hospital nurses of doubtful
character to tea, which was extremely seldom,
he did not even wait on them himself;
he kept servants for that very purpose.
Possibly those extraordinary facts may be
accounted for by his not being a wicked lord,
nor even a misguided baronet.</p>

<p>John Hammond was seated at home on
the morning after the concert, considering
his position. Immediately after the scene in
the picture-gallery overnight he had come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
away, feeling as if his world had crumbled
into ruin around him. He had saved the
woman he loved from the marchioness&#8217;s
scorn; he could not save her from his own.
And the other woman, whom he had considered
his friend, to whom he had offered himself
in all good-will, believing that she had
affection to give him, if not love&mdash;he had
discovered that her heart was engaged, and
that she regarded marriage with him as a
hateful necessity.</p>

<p>He had sent her a note, brief, courteous,
and dignified. In it he had not used one
word that might seem to accuse her; he had
taken the entire blame upon himself. He
had stated simply that he found he could not
offer her the love of a husband, and he had
placed himself in her hands. Now he was
waiting for her answer.</p>

<p>But though he was waiting to hear from
Lady Victoria, he was thinking of Belle
Yorke. There are two kinds of misfortune
which sometimes come upon a man at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
same time; and one makes a public arrival,
and it harasses him a great deal, but the
other comes in silence and in secrecy, and it
wrecks his life.</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door, and a
footman announced Captain Mauleverer.</p>

<p>For the first time in the history of their
friendship the two men faced each other
with mutual embarrassment. The captain,
like a sensible man, went straight at his
fence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Hammond, I am awfully
sorry I made such an ass of myself last
night. I&#8217;m afraid I have given you a wrong
impression about Victoria.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Why should you say that?&#8221; Hammond
replied in a tone of indifference.</p>

<p>Mauleverer looked at him anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I have led you to think there
was something between us, that she&mdash;well,
in fact, that she cared about me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond gave a weary shrug.</p>

<p>&#8220;What of it? What does it matter?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s very decent of you to take it so well,&#8221;
said the puzzled captain. &#8220;I was afraid that
I might have unwittingly injured her in your
mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, oh no; don&#8217;t think that. There was
no hypocrisy about Lady Victoria, I can assure
you. She didn&#8217;t pretend to be in love
with me, and I didn&#8217;t pretend to be in love
with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You asked her to marry you,&#8221; observed
the other, in a tone of remonstrance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know; I did it to please my constituents,
as she was aware. A public man has to do
that sort of thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely you expected her to care for you
in time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I merely expected her to canvass
for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mauleverer began to feel baffled by this
cynical indifference.</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem to take a very curious tone,&#8221; he
said, after a moment. &#8220;Of course, you understand
that, whatever feeling I may have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
had for her in the past, I shall never think
of her again except as a cousin.&#8221;</p>

<p>In spite of his own inward trouble, Hammond
could not resist a smile at the honest
captain&#8217;s efforts to plead against himself.
He gave him an amused glance as he retorted:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid that is rather ambiguous. I
have known cousins who were very much
attached to each other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hammond, do you doubt me when I
tell you that from this moment Victoria will
be perfectly indifferent to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you piled it on pretty strongly last
night, you know. I can&#8217;t help thinking that
you are rather more fond of her than you
pretend. But there is no need to get excited
about it; it makes no difference to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mauleverer gazed at him in dismay.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that the way in which you speak
about your future wife?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Hammond, shaking his head
decidedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hammond, what does this mean? You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
say that my attachment to Victoria makes
no difference to you, and yet you no longer
wish to marry her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It means that I have made a mistake,
and that I have to get out of it the best way
I can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Old man, this is my doing. This is
because of what I said to you last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; Hammond became earnest for the
first time. &#8220;I am very glad you said what
you did, because if I had had the vanity to
think that Lady Victoria cared twopence
about me, you would have undeceived me.
But the reason why I have determined not
to marry her is not merely because I believe
she loves you, but because I have discovered
that I love another woman too well ever to
marry any one besides.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Great heavens! Is that it?&#8221; Mauleverer
exclaimed. He recalled the scene of last
night, and began dimly to understand it.</p>

<p>Hammond proceeded to enlighten him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you think that I was jealous of you?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
Why, man, if I had loved your cousin with
one-hundredth part of the love I have for
that other, I should have taken you by the
throat last night when you said what you
did. Jealous of you? No, but of that man
whose years protect him from my anger,
though they have not protected youth and
innocence from him. It is Lord Severn, not
you, who has robbed me of the woman I love;
and let me tell you that if I had no other reason
for breaking the hollow, lying pledge I
gave last night, I would sooner cut off this
hand than give it to the daughter of the man
who is guilty of Belle Yorke&#8217;s betrayal!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My God!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mauleverer sat transfixed as the whole
truth of the situation burst upon him. Twice
he opened his lips to speak, and twice he
recollected that the secret had been intrusted
to his honor. He was on the point of springing
to his feet to go, when the door opened
and the footman came in.</p>

<p>&#8220;A Mr. Yorke, sir, wishes to see you. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
is in the hall,&#8221; announced the stately creature
with icy impassibility.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Yorke?&#8221; repeated Hammond, bewildered.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is a rather young man, sir.&#8221; The
information was vouchsafed with a crushing
absence of emotion. &#8220;I should judge
him to be about thirteen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond started and changed color.
Then he said with quiet emphasis:</p>

<p>&#8220;Show the young gentleman in.&#8221;</p>

<p>If ever footman permitted himself to show
human feelings, assuredly a faint gleam of
something resembling surprise played across
the visage of that footman as he withdrew.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is it?&#8221; asked Mauleverer, amused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Belle Yorke&#8217;s brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>The footman threw open the door. With
perfect self-control, with a beautiful unconsciousness
of whether he was announcing a
member of the royal family or a detective
with a warrant for his master&#8217;s arrest, he
uttered the words:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>&#8220;Mr. Yorke.&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain saw a rather undersized boy
in knickerbockers, with his fists tightly
clenched and a flush of excitement on his
cheeks, who walked boldly into the centre
of the room, and there stood still.</p>

<p>Hammond, who had already risen, went
towards the boy with extended hand. Mr.
Yorke drew back, and kept his own hands
down by his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather not shake hands with you,
please, Mr. Hammond.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man started, and dropped his hand
with a strange look.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you sit down?&#8221; he asked, quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather not, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond bowed, and remained standing
himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come to see you about my sister.
Miss Belle Yorke. She hasn&#8217;t any father,
you know, so I&#8217;m her protector.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, my boy, I&#8217;m sure you are,&#8221; said
Hammond, very gently.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>Mr. Yorke went on, with a certain feverish
energy:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s rather difficult for me to speak to you,
because I don&#8217;t know exactly what you&#8217;ve
done to Belle; but I know it&#8217;s your doing,
whatever it is, because you used to be her
sweetheart, and now she says she shall never
see you any more. You&#8217;ve broken her heart,
and she wouldn&#8217;t eat any breakfast this
morning, and mother says she will give
up the stage; and I believe she&#8217;s been
crying, though she won&#8217;t own to it. And
I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re a gentleman, Mr. Hammond.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond&#8217;s head was drooping on his
breast.</p>

<p>&#8220;God knows that!&#8221; he muttered.</p>

<p>&#8220;So I have come here to tell you that I
consider you&#8217;ve no right to treat Belle like
that, and I&#8217;m not going to stand it. And as
soon as I&#8217;m old enough, I&#8217;m going to challenge
you to a duel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My child!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>The exclamation burst from the man unawares.
Mr. Yorke turned very red.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s very offensive of you to call
me that,&#8221; he said, wrathfully, &#8220;and it isn&#8217;t
treating me as you ought to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; said the man,
humbly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And if you think,&#8221; Mr. Yorke went on
fiercely, &#8220;that you can take advantage of my
being young to refuse me satisfaction, I shall
think you&#8217;re not very honorable, because you
knew Belle had only me to protect her when
you broke her heart. And I&#8217;ve come here to
ask you, as a gentleman, to wait till I am
twenty-one, so that I can fight you. It&#8217;s
only eight years and two months, and I expect
you to give me your word of honor that you
will wait till then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir.&#8221; Mr. Yorke became
more friendly. &#8220;It&#8217;s only fair for me to tell
you that I&#8217;m going to save up and buy a
revolver and practise every day, so you had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
better do the same. I don&#8217;t want to take
any advantage of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a brave fellow,&#8221; said Hammond.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I think that&#8217;s all. Good-morning,
Mr. Hammond.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-morning, Mr. Yorke.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond rang the bell, and advanced to
open the door of the room. Mr. Yorke was
half-way out when he paused in the doorway.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Mr. Hammond,&#8221; he said, his manner
suddenly changing to thorough boyishness,
&#8220;do you mind promising me, as a great
favor, that you won&#8217;t tell mother or Belle
about this, or they mightn&#8217;t let me buy the
revolver?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond bowed kindly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I promise.&#8221;</p>

<p>The footman appeared outside.</p>

<p>&#8220;Show Mr. Yorke out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Yorke, regaining his dignity, made
his exit in state, leaving the two men looking
at each other.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>&#8220;By Jove! that was a little trump!&#8221; Mauleverer
burst out as the door closed. &#8220;Not
much the matter with the modern child,
after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond nodded as he cast himself wearily
into a chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mind going now, old man?&#8221; he
said, bluntly.</p>

<p>Mauleverer sprang up with a sudden recollection,
hurried out on to the pavement,
hailed the nearest cab, and dashed off to
Berkeley Square.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">SCENE XV<br />


<small>A MISFORTUNE FOR SOCIETY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hammond</span> was not left to himself for very
long. The marchioness waited to give her
nephew time to clear the way, and then took
the field in person.</p>

<p>When he heard her name, a sardonic
smile crossed Hammond&#8217;s lips. He stood
up to receive her, a very different man to
the one whom Belle Yorke&#8217;s brother had
encountered.</p>

<p>The marchioness walked in with an angry
gleam in her eyes. Hammond at once proceeded
to draw first blood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Show Mr. Despencer in!&#8221; he called out
to the footman, looking out through the door
as if in the expectation of seeing that gentleman
outside.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>&#8220;Mr. Despencer is not with me, Mr. Hammond,&#8221;
said the marchioness shortly, biting
her lips.</p>

<p>Mr. Hammond affected to be surprised.</p>

<p>&#8220;I apologize!&#8221; he exclaimed, as the footman
withdrew. &#8220;But this is very good of you,
marchioness. Where will you sit?&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness planted herself in an
arm-chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you know, Mr. Hammond, why
I have called?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond seated himself comfortably in
another easy-chair opposite, and crossed his
legs.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, unless it&#8217;s about that unfortunate affair
last evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Hammond!&#8221; The marchioness darted
a glance of withering rebuke at the recalcitrant
suitor. &#8220;Is that the way in which
you refer to the fact that you are engaged
to my daughter Victoria?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Was</i> engaged, excuse me, marchioness,&#8221;
he corrected, with easy good-nature. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
you know that I had written to Lady Victoria
to beg off?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is in consequence of your extraordinary
letter that I have come here,&#8221; said the marchioness,
scowling. &#8220;I trust you will have
the good sense and right feeling to withdraw
it before my daughter is compelled to give it
any reply.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid I can&#8217;t oblige you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The answer was given quietly enough, but
the marchioness looked in his face and saw
something there which she did not like.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you considered the effect of such a
step as this on my daughter&#8217;s reputation?&#8221;
she demanded, with dignity.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see that it need go beyond ourselves,&#8221;
Hammond replied. &#8220;Nobody else
knows of it but Mr. Despencer, and your
influence with him&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness interrupted, breathing
angrily:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are utterly wrong there. The engagement
is public property. I understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
you yourself have freely mentioned it to your
friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I? Never!&#8221;</p>

<p>He stared at her in amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me, I have proof of what I say,&#8221;
she affirmed. &#8220;And Victoria has done the
same. She has mentioned it to her friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry to hear that.&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness began to hope.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must see that, under the circumstances,
you have no alternative, as a gentleman,
but to withdraw your letter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid I don&#8217;t see it. I would much
rather leave myself in Lady Victoria&#8217;s
hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you no regard for her feelings,
pray?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Every regard. If she tells me that she
still wishes to marry me, I shall keep my
word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have no right whatever to throw the
decision on her. Have you no consideration
for her parents?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>Hammond&#8217;s lip curled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I haven&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness glared at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Hammond, are you a gentleman?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it is rather a question, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
he responded, with a cheerful smile which
drove her frantic.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know that our family is one of
the oldest in Great Britain?&#8221; she demanded,
after a moment&#8217;s pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Precisely. And mine is one of the newest.
It would really have been a <i>m&eacute;salliance</i>,
my dear marchioness.&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness could hardly believe her
ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you <i>no</i> regard for descent?&#8221; she
gasped. &#8220;My daughter has royal blood in
her veins, Mr. Hammond.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! there you have me at a disadvantage,&#8221;
he returned. &#8220;All my female ancestors
were respectable married women.&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness turned crimson. It was
well known that the royal blood in the house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
of Mauleverer had entered it by irregular
channels.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not accustomed to this kind of language,&#8221;
she proclaimed, rising. &#8220;I shall request
the marquis to call on you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That will suit me a great deal better. I
shall be able to talk to the marquis,&#8221; was the
grim answer.</p>

<p>The marchioness swept towards the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see I have made a mistake in coming
here. I begin to ask myself whether you
were really aware of what you were doing
yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond smiled pleasantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, now, that sounds like rather a good
explanation. I can say I was intoxicated,
can&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness broke off short, her eyes
fixed in stony horror on the doorway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lady Victoria Mauleverer and Mr. Despencer!&#8221;</p>

<p>Victoria had been still considering how to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
deal with the letter she had received from
Mr. Hammond, when the treacherous Despencer
had come and informed her that her
mother was on the way to her lover&#8217;s house
to bring him to book. Her mind was instantly
made up. She put on a hat, impressed
Despencer into the service, ordered
a hansom, and drove off on the track of her
parent.</p>

<p>The two newcomers were in the room,
and the door had closed on the departing
footman, before the marchioness recovered
herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Victoria, you will oblige me by leaving
this house immediately. I order it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Victoria laughed negligently.</p>

<p>&#8220;How absurd you are this morning,
mother! You keep forgetting that I am over
twenty-one,&#8221; she remarked. Then, crossing
over to Hammond, she held out her hand
with frank good-will. &#8220;Good-morning, Mr.
Hammond!&#8221;</p>

<p>The sight of her daughter calmly shaking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
hands with the man who had jilted her,
as if nothing had happened, nearly turned
her mother&#8217;s hair gray. Fortunately it
was from the best maker, and could not
turn gray.</p>

<p>&#8220;Victoria,&#8221; she said, in a suffocated voice,
&#8220;if you have no respect for yourself, perhaps
you will have some respect for me! Mr.
Hammond has grossly insulted me. Mr.
Despencer, will you be good enough to take
me to my carriage?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, he can&#8217;t do that yet,&#8221; interposed Victoria.
&#8220;I brought him here as my chaperon,
and I haven&#8217;t done with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Despencer glanced from the daughter to
the mother. The contest was between fear
and love.</p>

<p>&#8220;I apologize for being so badly constructed,&#8221;
he murmured, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t take in halves.
Will it do if I give somebody my visiting-card?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall not go till you do, Victoria. I
decline to leave you alone with Mr. Hammond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
again,&#8221; the marchioness said, spitefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t be impressive,&#8221; was Victoria&#8217;s
unkind reply. Then, turning to Hammond
and speaking rapidly, she went on:
&#8220;I got that amusing note of yours. I came
round to tell you that of course I quite understood
that it was all a joke last night.
We ought not to have said anything to my
mother, because she is so easily taken in,
and she believed we were quite serious. But
I enjoyed the fun myself very much, and I
mean to make Gerald awfully jealous about
you when we are married.&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness blinked her eyes as
though a sword had flashed before them,
as she saw herself thus shamefully discarded
and her last hope gone by the board.
As for Despencer, he regarded Victoria with
the admiring glance of an artist for a brilliant
piece of work, in a kind which he understands.</p>

<p>Hammond bowed gratefully.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>&#8220;Lady Victoria, you can do anything you
like with Mauleverer and me except make
us quarrel.&#8221;</p>

<p>The marchioness came to herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by talking about
marrying Gerald?&#8221; she demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear mother, I suppose we must marry
some time. We have been engaged long
enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Engaged!&#8221; the poor marchioness could
only ejaculate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I thought everybody in London
knew that,&#8221; said Victoria, calmly. &#8220;I am
sure Mr. Hammond did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Excellent!&#8221; Despencer murmured to
himself. &#8220;She has come off with flying
colors.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Engaged to a pauper!&#8221; the marchioness
exclaimed, tragically. &#8220;And, pray, what do
you propose to live on?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that is quite settled,&#8221; her daughter
answered. &#8220;I have arranged to open a milliner&#8217;s
shop in Piccadilly.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>&#8220;I thought everybody in London knew
that,&#8221; remarked Despencer heartlessly.</p>

<p>It was the stab of Brutus. The marchioness
turned a look on the traitor that should
have rooted him to the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mis-ter De-spencer!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, marchioness?&#8221;</p>

<p>There had been a sound of wheels below.
A carriage had driven up to the door. Captain
Mauleverer had not been idle during the
hour which had elapsed since his departure.
Footsteps ascended the staircase; the door
leading into an adjoining room was opened
and shut. Then&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>The Marquis of Severn!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>As the marquis entered the room which
his wife and daughter were in already,
Hammond took a step forward, looking
very pale and determined. Lady Victoria
drew quietly towards a window, followed
by Despencer. The marchioness, standing
in the centre of the room, addressed her
husband:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>&#8220;George! Do you know what has happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>The marquis, after his first momentary
surprise at finding them there, had taken no
notice of any one but Hammond, on whom
his eyes were fixed with an expression of
mingled reproach and excuse. The excuse
Hammond thought he understood, but the
reproach puzzled him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know too much,&#8221; the marquis began.
&#8220;Hammond, I have something to say to
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t we better wait till we are by ourselves?&#8221;
said Hammond, with a significant
look. &#8220;I have something to say to you as
well.&#8221;</p>

<p>The marquis glanced round, first at his
wife and then at Despencer.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I cannot have too many listeners,
for I have to crush a slander and to make a
reparation.&#8221; He stepped to the door and
opened it. &#8220;Come in, Gerald!&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Mauleverer came in, but not alone.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
Clinging to his arm, with downcast head,
as if she almost feared to see her lover&#8217;s remorse,
came Belle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great God!&#8221; As the oath burst from
him all the blood in his veins surged up
to Hammond&#8217;s heart, and ebbed away again,
leaving him white and faint. It needed not
for Belle&#8217;s father to speak, the mere sight of
her convicted him.</p>

<p>The marquis spoke, drawing Belle to him,
and facing each of his listeners in turn with
a brave dignity.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have just learned, within the last hour,
that this young lady has been made the victim
of one of the blackest falsehoods ever
uttered, a falsehood in which my name is
connected with hers. It is true that she and
I are connected. We have been connected
for nearly twenty years, and all that time I
have endeavored, rightly or wrongly, to keep
the fact of our connection a secret from the
world. How that secret has been penetrated
I do not know; but now that I do know the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
damnable interpretation which has been
placed upon my conduct, I am determined to
proclaim the truth to the whole world. I
cannot atone for the injury I have done her
in the past, but I will at least do my best to
guard her in the present. Hammond, this
is my daughter.&#8221;</p>

<p>A profound silence succeeded. The marchioness
was frightened. Despencer was
conscious of a faint emotion to which he
had long been a stranger, and which he
supposed to be honest shame. Hammond
was too much moved to speak. Victoria
hesitated only for an instant, then she went
up to Belle impulsively and kissed her on
the cheek.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord Severn,&#8221; said Hammond, slowly, as
soon as he could master himself, &#8220;you have
done me the greatest service one man can
do to another, and you have crushed me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;George!&#8221; ventured the marchioness.</p>

<p>Her husband frowned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go home, Jane!&#8221; he said, curtly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>And that great woman walked out of
the room as crestfallen as a small urchin
that has been caught doing mischief and
spanked.</p>

<p>Despencer followed of his own accord,
without doing more than whisper to Hammond
as he passed:</p>

<p>&#8220;I never apologize, and I never commit
suicide, but I mean to be very firm with
that marchioness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Victoria took her cousin&#8217;s arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I couldn&#8217;t think why Mr. Hammond
jilted me this morning,&#8221; she laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t think why he ever proposed to
you,&#8221; retorted Gerald, smartly.</p>

<p>And they, too, went out.</p>

<p>The marquis stood silent for a minute,
his daughter leaning on his arm. She had
not yet dared to look up at Hammond.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there anything else that you would
like to say?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond started at the question. The
color began slowly to return to his face.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>&#8220;I should like you to beg your daughter
to forgive me&mdash;if she ever can.&#8221;</p>

<p>The marquis looked down at Belle and
gently patted the head that rested on his
arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you say?&#8221; he asked her.</p>

<p>The eyes remained downcast. The answer
came, very soft and low:</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell him that it wasn&#8217;t his fault, and, if
it was, I had forgiven him already.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her father looked back again at Hammond.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything else?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hammond began to tremble. There was
color enough, and to spare, in his face now.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yesterday evening your daughter told me
that she did not love me. I should like you
to ask her if there is any hope that she will
ever change her mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, my dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Belle&#8217;s turn to tremble.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell him&mdash;tell him that I shall never
change my mind. But&#8221;&mdash;she raised her eyes
at last, with that look which only comes into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
a woman&#8217;s eyes once in her life, and which
only one man sees there&mdash;&#8220;but&mdash;that I don&#8217;t
always speak the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Marquis of Severn went out quietly,
leaving them together.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

provided that:

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
